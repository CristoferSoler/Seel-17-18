### 1.1 Introduction

The purpose of data protection is to protect individuals from being affected by the handling of personal data on the part of institutions in the exercise of fundamental rights. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany guarantees the right of the citizens to determine themselves in principle about the use of their personal data. The data protection laws of the Federation and the Federal States refer to them when they emphasize the protection of the right to informational self-determination. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights directly establishes in Article 8 the right to the protection of personal data (paragraph 1), highlights the need for a legal basis for data processing (paragraph 2) and requires the monitoring of compliance with data protection rules by an independent body (para 3). The Basic Data Protection Regulation [DSGVO] details these requirements of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Of paramount importance is Article 5 GDPR, which collects the principles, some of which are * protected *. The Standard Privacy Model (SDM) provides a methodology to systematically monitor this required implementation of data protection regulations, based on seven protection objectives or warranty objectives.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of the module is to represent the connection of the requirements of the standard data protection model to IT-Grundschutz.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The Conference of Independent Data Protection Authorities of the Federation and the Länder has developed a concept with the Standard Data Protection Model that systematises the technical and organizational measures mentioned in the German and European legislation on the basis of warranty objectives. On the one hand, the model thus serves to systematically plan and implement the measures required for the processing, and thus promotes the data protection-appropriate design and organization of information technology processes and applications. On the other hand, the model offers data protection authorities the opportunity to arrive at a transparent, comprehensible and reliable overall judgment of a procedure and its components with a uniform system. The SDM is a method of regularly reviewing, evaluating and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures of processing on the basis of and in accordance with the criteria of the GDPR.

When choosing suitable technical and organizational measures, the SDM takes into account the perspective of the person concerned and his exercise of fundamental rights and therefore differs fundamentally from the point of view of IT-Grundschutz. IT-Grundschutz focuses primarily on information security and aims to protect the data processing institution. For the selection of measures according to the SDM, on the other hand, the impairment which an affected person has to accept through the data processing of the institution is decisive.

Against this background, a distinction must be made between the selection of measures to ensure information security for institutions by responsible bodies and measures to ensure the rights of the victims. The IT-Grundschutz methodology primarily serves information security, the standard data protection model serves to implement data subject rights.

The default privacy model therefore has the following claims:

* It translates data protection requirements into a catalog of warranty objectives.
* It divides the considered procedures into the components data, IT systems and processes.
* It takes into account the classification of data into the three protection demand levels normal, high and very high and complements them with appropriate considerations at the level of processes and IT systems.
* It offers a systematically derived catalog with standardized protective measures.
2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​*** *** privacy:

### 2 1 Disregard of privacy laws or use of an incomplete risk model

According to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the processing of personal data is generally prohibited and requires a legal basis. The collection, use and transfer of personal data is only permitted if a legal provision permits or orders this or if an affected party has consented (see Article 6 [GDPR]).

From the point of view of data protection, the institution that collects, uses, transmits or receives (collectively: "processed") personal data generally involves a risk for individuals. Nothing changes in this risk if the data processing of an institution is legally compliant.

On the other hand, there is a further increased risk for persons if an institution does not adequately purposely undertake data processing or carry out its purpose overdue or completely unintelligible or intransparent or without integrity-securing measures and without adequate options for intervention by those affected.

In practice, a particularly high risk for those affected is access by potentially authorized third parties. These may typically be foreign group mothers, security authorities, banks and insurance companies, public service administrators, IT manufacturers, and IT service providers (for example, through acquired patients and clients Directories) or research institutions. Often, in these contexts, the regularity of an access is not checked, for example, because a long-standing practice is continued or because junior employees shy away from personal risk, which may be due to the existence of a sufficient legal basis. Furthermore, from (partly) negative test results by a legal department or a data protection officer often no consequences are drawn by the responsible persons.

A further risk for both persons and responsible institutions exists if there are no standard processes for (usually only conditional) access to IT services or the transfer of data for legitimate access by third parties, or if no evidence is available Regularity of implementation, in the form of protocols and documentation.

Another major danger for people is a lack of data security. Recital 75 of the GDPR describes the risks associated with the processing of personal data and thus the vulnerability due to unauthorized access as follows:
"The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons - of varying likelihood and severity - may arise from the processing of personal data that could result in physical, material or immaterial damage, in particular if the processing results in discrimination, identity theft or fraud financial loss, reputational harm, loss of confidentiality of personal data subject to professional secrecy, unauthorized termination of pseudonymisation or other significant economic or social disadvantage, if the data subjects are deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from doing so personal data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or ideological beliefs or affiliation and that data relating to genetic data, health data or sex life or criminal convictions and offenses or related safeguards are processed when assessing personal aspects, in particular when considering aspects of work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences or Interests that relate to reliability or behavior, whereabouts or relocation, are analyzed or forecasted to create or use personal profiles when personal data of vulnerable natural persons, especially child data, are processed or when the processing involves a large amount of personal information Data and a large number of data subjects. "

### 2 2 Setting too low a protection requirement

Another danger for persons is the establishment of an inappropriate protection requirement. A misuse of protection requirements would result in failure to comply with essential data protection requirements for the functions of a procedure and the operation of specific data protection measures. The need for protection, which is typically set by the institution itself, who is responsible for processing personal information, may be incorrect or underestimated from the point of view of individuals for a variety of reasons:

* The institution has not taken into account the privacy protection privacy protection catalog.
* The institution did not differentiate between the risks for the implementation of the fundamental rights of the persons concerned and the risks for the institution in the identification of protection needs.
* Although the institution has distinguished the two protection interests, it has designed the functions of the procedure and protective measures in favor of the institution or to the detriment of the persons concerned.
3 requirements
---------------

The following are specific privacy requirements. In principle, the data protection officer is responsible for monitoring compliance with the requirements of the GDPR (for details and restrictions see Art. 39 GDPR). Deviations from this are mentioned separately in the corresponding requirements. The Information Security Officer (ISB) should always be involved in strategic decisions. In addition, the ISB is responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy.

### 3.1 Basic requirements

The following requirements MUST be implemented as a priority:

#### CON.2.A1 implementation standard privacy model
The standard data protection model is the tool to set up and operate personal procedures not only securely but also in accordance with data protection laws. It therefore MUST be checked if the SDM is used. Any failure to consider the full list of protected objectives and non-application of the SDM methodology and reference measures MUST be justified.

### 3.2 Standard requirements

Together with the basic requirements, the following requirements correspond to the state of the art in the area of ​​data protection. They SHOULD be implemented in principle.

### 3.3 Requirements for increased protection requirements

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that exceed the state of the art level of protection and should be considered IN THE EVENT OF INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).
