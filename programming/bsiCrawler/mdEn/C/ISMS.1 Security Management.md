### 1.1 Introduction

Information security management, or IS management for short, is the planning, control and monitoring task required to build and continuously implement a well-thought-out and effective information security process. A functioning security management must be embedded in the existing management structures of each institution. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to specify a security management organization structure that is directly applicable to each institution. Rather, adjustments to specific circumstances will often be required.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to demonstrate how well-functioning information security management can be set up and further developed during operation. He describes meaningful steps in a systematic security process and gives instructions for creating a comprehensive security concept.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The building block is based on the BSI Standard 100-1 Information Security Management Systems and BSI Standard 100-2 Approach to IT Baseline Protection and summarizes the most important aspects of security management.

2 risk situation
-----------------

Threats and vulnerabilities in the field of security management can be diverse in nature. Often they are symptom of a poor overall organization of the security process. Representing this multitude of threats and vulnerabilities, this module considers the following typical threats:

### 2 1 Lack of personal responsibility in the security process

If the roles in the security process are not clearly defined in an institution, it is likely that many employees will reject their responsibility for information security by referring to higher hierarchy levels. As a result, security measures are not implemented, since these initially almost always represent additional work in the usual workflow.

### 2 2 Lack of support from senior management

Information security officers usually do not come from the level of government or company management. Failure to fully support security officers by senior management may make it difficult to effectively require the necessary action from those in the line structure above them. In this case, the security process is not completely feasible.

### 2 3 Insufficient strategic and conceptual requirements

Although many institutions create a security concept, their content is often known only to a few insiders. This leads to the fact that the guidelines are not consciously or unconsciously adhered to in places where organizational effort would be required. If the security concept contains strategic objectives, these are often regarded as a mere collection of declarations of intent and insufficient resources are provided for their implementation. In many cases, it is erroneously assumed that safety is automatically produced in an automated environment. Cases of damage in one's own or similarly structured institutions are sometimes the trigger for more or less vigorous actionism, in which at best partial aspects are improved at best.

### 2 4 Insufficient or misdirected investmentsIf the governance level of an institution is not adequately informed about the security status of business processes, IT systems and applications and about existing deficiencies, insufficient resources are made available or used improperly for the security process. In the latter case, this may mean that an excessively high level of safety in one area is faced with serious deficiencies in another area. It is also frequently observed that expensive technical security solutions are used incorrectly and thus are ineffective or even themselves become a source of danger.

### 2 5 Insufficient enforceability of security measures

Achieving a consistent and adequate level of security requires that different areas of responsibility within an institution cooperate with each other. Missing strategic statements and unclear objectives sometimes lead to different interpretations of the importance of information security. This may have the consequence that the necessary cooperation for alleged lack of necessity or insufficient prioritization of the task "information security" ultimately omitted and thus the enforceability of security measures is not given.

### 2 6 Missing update in the security process

New business processes, applications and IT systems, as well as new threats, permanently affect the status of information security within an institution. If an effective revision concept is lacking, which also strengthens the awareness of the new threats, the level of security is reduced and real security gradually becomes dangerous bogus security.

### 2 7 Breach of legal regulations and contractual agreements

If information, business processes and IT systems of an institution are insufficiently secured (for example due to inadequate security management), this may result in violations of laws related to information processing or existing contracts with business partners. Which laws have to be respected depends on the type of institution or its business processes and services. Depending on where the locations of an institution are located, different national and international regulations may have to be observed. If an institution has insufficient knowledge of international legal requirements (for example, data protection, information obligations, insolvency law, liability or information access for third parties), this increases the risk of corresponding violations. There are threats of legal consequences.

In many industries it is customary for users to oblige their suppliers and service providers to comply with certain quality and safety standards. In this context, information security requirements are also increasing. If a contracting party violates contractually regulated security requirements, this can lead to contractual penalties, but also to contract cancellations or the loss of business relationships.

### 2 8 Business disruption due to security incidentsSecurity incidents can be triggered by a singular event or concatenation of unfortunate circumstances that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and IT systems. This then quickly has a negative effect on essential specialist tasks and business processes of the institution concerned. Even if not all security incidents become known to the public, they can still have a negative impact on relationships with business partners and customers. It is not even the case that the most significant and far-reaching security incidents were triggered by the largest security vulnerabilities. In many cases, the chaining of small causes has led to huge damage.

### 2 9 Inefficient use of resources due to inadequate safety management

Inadequate security management can lead to the setting of wrong priorities and not investing in those areas that bring the greatest added value to the institution. This can lead to the following errors:

* It invests in expensive security solutions without a base of necessary organizational regulations. Unclear responsibilities and responsibilities can lead to serious security incidents despite expensive investments.
* Investing in the areas of an information security institution that is particularly sensitive to information security. Other areas that may be more important in fulfilling the specific tasks and achieving the business goals are neglected due to scarce resources or disinterestedness of those in charge.
* It is only invested in individual areas. However, there are significant security holes in the overall system.
* By unilaterally increasing the protection of individual core values, total protection may be reduced.
* Inhomogeneous and uncoordinated use of security products can lead to high financial and human resource utilization.
3 requirements
---------------

The following are the specific requirements for security management. Basically, the Information Security Officer (ISB) is responsible for meeting the requirements. Deviations from this are mentioned separately in the corresponding requirements. The ISB should always be involved in strategic decisions. In addition, the ISB is responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy. In addition, there may be other roles that have additional responsibilities in the implementation of requirements. These are then listed explicitly in square brackets in the heading of the respective requirements.

### 3.1 Basic requirements

The following requirements MUST be implemented as a priority:

#### ISMS.1.A1 Assumption of overall responsibility for information security by the management level [institutional management]

The security strategy and objectives MUST be borne and held by the institution's leadership. Security objectives and strategy MUST be regularly reviewed to see if they are up to date, appropriate and effective.

#### ISMS.1.A3 Creation of an information security guideline [Head of Institution]

The governance level MUST adopt an overarching information security guideline that describes the importance of information security, security objectives, key aspects of the security strategy, and the information security governance structure. The security policy MUST have a clear scope. The information security policy MUST explain the security objectives and the relation of the security objectives to the business objectives and tasks of the institution.

The information security guideline MUST be disclosed to all employees and other members of the institution. It SHOULD be updated regularly.

#### ISMS.1.A4 Appointment of an Information Security Officer [Head of Institution]

The management level MUST designate an information security officer who promotes information security in the institution and controls and coordinates the security process. The Information Security Officer MUST be provided with adequate resources. He MUST have the opportunity to report directly to senior management if required. The Information Security Officer MUST be adequately qualified and have sufficient opportunity to receive further training.

The Information Security Officer MUST be involved early in all major projects, as well as in the introduction of new applications and IT systems.

#### ISMS.1.A5 Contract drafting when ordering an external information security officer [institutional management]

The service contract must include all tasks of the Information Security Officer and the associated rights and obligations. The contract MUST include an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The external information security officer MUST have the necessary qualifications. The contract MUST ensure a controlled termination of the contractual relationship including the transfer of tasks to the client.

#### ISMS.1.A6 Establishment of a suitable organizational structure for information security [Institutional Management]

There must be an appropriate, comprehensive organizational structure for information security. For this, roles MUST be defined that perform the various tasks required to achieve the security goals. You must also name people who are qualified and have sufficient resources to complete these roles. The tasks, responsibilities and competencies in security management MUST be comprehensibly defined and assigned. For all major functions of the IS organization, there must be effective representation arrangements.

Communication channels MUST be planned, described, set up and made public. It MUST be defined for all tasks and roles, who informs whom and who has to be informed about which actions and to what extent.It is MUST be checked regularly whether the organizational structure for information security is still appropriate or needs to be adapted to new framework conditions.

#### ISMS.1.A7 Determination of security measures

The security process MUST establish detailed and adequate security measures for all information processing. All security measures SHOULD be systematically documented in security concepts and regularly updated.

#### ISMS.1.A8 Integration of employees into the security process [supervisors]

All employees MUST be integrated into the security process, that is, they must be aware of the background and threats and be aware of and implement security measures that affect their workplace. They MUST be enabled to actively participate in the design of security, ie to contribute to their business processes. Therefore, the employees SHOULD be involved early in the planning of security measures or the organization of organizational regulations.

When introducing security policies and security tools, employees MUST be sufficiently informed about how to apply them.

#### ISMS.1.A9 Integrating Information Security into Organizational Procedures and Processes [Head of Institution]

Information security MUST be integrated into all business processes. It MUST be ensured that not only new processes and projects, but also ongoing activities take into account all the necessary safety aspects. Information security SHOULD also be aligned with other areas of the institution dealing with security and risk management.

The Information Security Officer MUST be sufficiently involved in security-related decisions.

### 3.2 Standard requirements

Together with the basic requirements, the following requirements correspond to the state of the art in the area of ​​safety management. They SHOULD be implemented in principle.

#### ISMS.1.A10 Creation of a security concept

For the defined scope (information network), an appropriate security concept SHOULD be created as the central document in the security process. The security concept can also consist of several sub-concepts, which are created successively in order to initially produce the required level of security in selected areas.

In the security concept, the security objectives of the institution, the identified protection requirements and the risk assessment MUST be used to derive concrete security measures appropriate to the considered information network. Security process and security concept MUST consider the individual rules and regulations.

The measures provided for in the security concept MUST be implemented promptly in practice. This MUST be planned and the implementation controlled. It SHOULD periodically review the suitability, adequacy, feasibility and efficiency of the measures selected to achieve the safety objectives and requirements.

Each employee SHOULD at least be informed about the parts of the security concept directly related to him.

#### ISMS.1.A11 maintaining information security

The security process, security concepts, information security guideline, and information security organizational structure SHOULD regularly be reviewed and updated for effectiveness and appropriateness. For this purpose, completeness or update checks of the security concept SHOULD be carried out regularly. Likewise, regular security audits should be carried out. For this purpose, it should be regulated which areas and security measures are to be checked when and by whom. Safety level checks SHOULD be carried out regularly (at least annually) and on an ad hoc basis.The tests SHOULD be performed by qualified and independent persons. The determined results of the checks SHOULD be comprehensibly documented. Based on this, deficiencies SHOULD be remedied and corrective measures taken.

#### ISMS.1.A12 Information Security Management Reports [Institutional Management]

The management level SHOULD regularly be informed about the state of information security, above all about the current threat situation and effectiveness and efficiency of the security process in order to be able to control the further procedure in the security process. The management reports SHOULD include the key relevant information about the security process, in particular about issues, achievements, and opportunities for improvement. They SHOULD contain clearly prioritized and proposed measures with realistic estimates of the expected implementation effort.

The management decisions about necessary actions, dealing with residual risks and with changes of security relevant processes SHOULD be documented. The management reports and management decisions SHOULD be archived audit-proof.

#### ISMS.1.A13 Documentation of the security process

The course of the security process, important decisions and the work results of the individual phases such as security concept, guidelines or investigation results of security incidents SHOULD be sufficiently documented.

It SHOULD provide a well-regulated procedure for the creation and archiving of documentation in the context of the security process. There SHOULD exist rules to maintain the timeliness and confidentiality of the documentation. Of the existing documents, the current version SHOULD be accessible at short notice. In addition, all previous versions SHOULD be centrally archived.

#### ISMS.1.A14 Information security awareness

All staff members of the institution and other relevant persons (such as external employees or project staff) SHOULD be sensitized to security risks in a systematic and target group-oriented manner and trained on information security issues (see ORP.3 Information Security and Information Security).

#### ISMS.1.A15 Economical Use of Information Security Resources

Information security requires sufficient financial and human resources as well as appropriate equipment. The need SHOULD be communicated by the ISB to the management level, which SHOULD provide the required resources.

The security strategy SHOULD consider economic aspects. When establishing security measures, the resources required for implementation SHOULD be quantified. The resources scheduled for information security SHOULD be delivered on schedule. The information security officer or information security management team MUST have enough time for their security tasks. In the event of peak work or special tasks, additional internal staff should be employed or external experts should be recruited.

### 3.3 Requirements for increased protection requirements

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that exceed the state of the art level of protection and should be considered IN THE EVENT OF INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ISMS.1.A16 Creation of Targeted Security Policies (CIA)All employees SHOULD know and respect the safety aspects of their work area. In order to convey security topics in a way that suits the target group, there should be not only the general but also target-group-oriented security guidelines that depict the relevant security topics as needed.

#### ISMS.1.A17 Completing Insurance (A)

It SHOULD be examined whether insurance policies should be taken out for residual risks in order to cover any possible damages. It SHOULD be checked on a regular basis to see if the existing insurance policies match the current situation.
