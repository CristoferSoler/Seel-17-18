### 1.1 Introduction

The staff of a company or authority forms the basis for its or its success or failure. At the same time, employees are an integral part of information security. Experience shows that even the most complex safety precautions without the correct behavior of the employees are ineffective. Awareness of what information security means to the institution and its business processes, and the proper treatment of employees with the information to be protected by the institution are therefore essential.

### 1.2 Objective

The purpose of this module is to identify what personal security measures are to be taken by the HR department or the supervisors of an institution so that employees can safely handle the institution's information and behave in accordance with the institution's security objectives and security requirements protective information. Starting with the hiring of employees until their departure, a variety of measures is required. In addition, of course, other groups of people who come into contact with the information of the institution should not be forgotten, such as employees of service providers and customers. Also for dealing with external, such. As visitors, cleaning personnel or maintenance technicians, appropriate security measures must be present.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module deals with the requirements that have to be observed and fulfilled by the HR department or the superiors of an institution. Personnel requirements that are tied to a specific function, such as For example, the appointment of the system administrator of a LAN, are listed in the modules that deal with the respective topic.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​human resources:

### 2 1 Staff shortage

The loss of personnel can mean that certain tasks can no longer or not be performed promptly.

### 2 2 Abuse of Permissions

Anyone who wants to edit information needs appropriate permissions. Users may misuse them by exploiting them to manipulate, transmit, or otherwise harm information.

### 2 3 Missing or inadequate regulations

If information security regulations are lacking, inadequate, unworkable or incomprehensible, this can lead to the necessary security measures not being implemented (see also G 0.29 Violation of laws or regulations).

### 2 4 Insufficient knowledge of regulations

The determination of regulations alone does not ensure their observance and trouble-free operation. All employees must also be aware of the applicable regulations, above all the officials. Damage that arises because existing regulations are not known, may not be excused with the statements: "I did not know that I am responsible." or "I did not know how to handle it."

### 2 5 Misconduct

Misbehavior of any type of person may interfere with the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information, business processes or IT systems. Depending on the need for protection of the information or the systems and depending on the authorizations of the polluters, the damages may be minor or critical.

### 2 6 Social Engineering

In social engineering, human characteristics such as Helpfulness, trust, fear or respect for authority are exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or IT systems through "listening out". This allows employees to be manipulated to act improperly.
### 2 7 Carelessness in handling information

Often it can be observed that while institutions have a large number of organizational and technical security procedures, they are again undermined by the careless handling of specifications and technology. A typical example of this are the almost proverbial notes on the monitor, on which access passwords are noted.

### 2 8 Unauthorized use of own IT systems

The unauthorized use of own IT systems by employees can generally be difficult to prevent. Using your own laptop, USB key, or smartphone within the IT landscape of an institution can lead to a variety of security risks, such as the inadvertent introduction of malicious programs.

### 2 9 Abuse of social networks

Social networks are very successful as platforms. However, in addition to the various advantages, there are also security risks that users should not lose sight of. So the data published on social networks can be used for the skillful password rate. In addition, social networks are particularly suitable for social engineering attacks, as here, on the one hand, a lot of background information can be collected and, on the other hand, the confidence assumed under "acquaintance" can be exploited.

### 2 10 Manipulation or destruction of equipment, information or software

Outside and inside perpetrators can try to manipulate or destroy devices, information or software for various reasons. The effects range from unauthorized access to sensitive data to the destruction of IT systems that can cause significant downtime.

3 requirements
---------------

The following are specific requirements for the personnel area. Basically, the HR department is responsible for fulfilling the requirements. Deviations from this are mentioned separately in the corresponding requirements. The Information Security Officer (ISB) should always be involved in strategic decisions. In addition, the ISB is responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy.

### 3.1 Basic requirements

The following requirements MUST be implemented as a priority:

#### ORP.2.A1 Regulated training of new employees [supervisors]

The personnel department and the supervisor MUST ensure that new employees incorporated at the beginning of their employment in their new tasks and be informed about existing regulations, practices and procedures. Here, a checklist SHOULD be supportive.

For the regular training of new employees, they MUST be made aware of existing regulations and instructions for information security. All employees MUST be informed about information security regulations, their changes and their specific impact on a business process or work environment.

All employees MUST be explicitly required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and internal regulations. In addition, all employees MUST be noted that all information obtained during the work are intended solely for internal use, as long as they are not marked otherwise.

#### ORP.2.A2 Regulated procedure for the departure of employees [supervisors, IT operations]
Before the departure of an employee, a timely briefing of the successor MUST be carried out, ideally by the departing employee. If a direct handover is not possible, a detailed documentation MUST be prepared by the departing employee. In addition, any outgoing employees MUST be required to collect all documents, keys, equipment, and IDs and access privileges received as part of their duties.

The IT administration must also ensure that former employees are deprived of all access rights to IT systems or that they are adjusted when tasks change.

Before the adoption MUST again be made explicit on confidentiality obligations.

Furthermore, emergency and other schedules MUST be updated. All affected entities within the institution, such as the security personnel, MUST also be informed of the employee's departure. In order to handle all activities that accompany the departure of employees in a regulated manner, the setting and the processing of a checklist SHOULD be helpful in a similar way to the attitude here.

#### ORP.2.A3 Representation Rules [Supervisors]

Supervisors MUST ensure the establishment and maintenance of representation arrangements. It must be ensured that appropriate and practicable representation arrangements exist for all essential business processes and tasks. In these regulations, the scope of the representation must be clearly defined in advance. In this case, the simple naming of a representative is not sufficient, but it MUST be ensured that he has the knowledge required for the representation. If this is not the case, MUST be checked as to how to train the representative or whether it is sufficient to document the current process or project status sufficiently. If, in exceptional cases, it is not possible to name or train a competent representative for individual employees, it must be considered at an early stage whether and, if so, which external forces can be used for the substitution case.

#### ORP.2.A4 Regulations for the use of external personnel

In the case of employment of external personnel, this must, like all employees, be obliged to comply with applicable laws, regulations and internal regulations. External or non-permanent deployed personnel can be treated like visitors and MUST be supervised in security relevant areas. In the case of long-term employed third-party personnel, in turn, this MUST be assigned to his or her duties in a similar way to their own employees. For such employees, a substitution regime MUST also be introduced. On their departure MUST be carried out in accordance with its own personnel a regulated transfer and return of the work results and possibly handed out access permissions.

#### ORP.2.A5 Confidentiality agreements for the use of outside personnel

Prior to receiving External Access and access to confidential information, it MUST enter into confidentiality agreements with them. The confidentiality agreements MUST take into account all important aspects of the protection of organizational information.

### 3.2 Standard requirements

Together with the basic requirements, the following requirements correspond to the state of the art in the field of personnel. They SHOULD be implemented in principle.

#### ORP.2.A6 Review of candidates in the selection of staff
When selecting new employees, the required qualifications and skills SHOULD be precisely formulated. Subsequently, it should be checked on the basis of the documents and in the interview whether they actually exist among the candidates. Particular care should be taken to ensure that no conflicts of interest occur. In order to avoid conflicts of interest after a job change, non-competition and waiting periods should be agreed.

#### ORP.2.A7 Checking the trustworthiness of employees

New employees SHOULD be checked for trustworthiness before they are hired. Therefore, all parties involved in the selection of personnel SHOULD endeavor with due diligence to check, as far as possible, the applicant's credentials, which are relevant for the assessment of their trustworthiness, as to their credibility. In particular, the submitted CV should be critically reviewed for completeness, plausibility and correctness. Critical data should be checked by dedicated demand and requesting further proof.

#### ORP.2.A8 Tasks and Responsibilities of Employees [Information Security Officer (ISB)]

The duties and responsibilities of employees SHOULD be documented in an appropriate manner, for example through employment contracts or agreements. The IT Security Officer SHOULD make sure that all employees know their duties and responsibilities in the security process. In particular, it SHOULD be agreed that every employee has a responsibility for information security outside of working hours and outside the premises.

#### ORP.2.A9 Training of employees

Employees SHOULD be trained on a regular basis according to their job so that they are always up-to-date with the tasks assigned to them. In all areas SHOULD be made sure that no employee based on an outdated state of knowledge of his work. Furthermore, the employees SHOULD be given the opportunity during their employment to continue their education within the scope of their field of activity.

All employees SHOULD be briefed on the equipment, applications, and activities that are used to safely process information. In addition, all employees SHOULD regularly be trained in information security and informed about everyday risks and possible countermeasures. The employees SHOULD also be encouraged to implement information security policies on their own responsibility. In the case of a greater need for training, individual employees SHOULD be trained separately and used within the area of ​​activity as multipliers for the remaining employees.

#### ORP.2.A10 Avoidance of disturbances of the working environment

From the point of view of information security, measures SHOULD be taken to ensure a positive working atmosphere.

### 3.3 Requirements for increased protection requirements

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that exceed the state of the art level of protection and should be considered IN THE EVENT OF INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ORP.2.A11 Safety culture analysis (CIA)
The security measures selected for the institution SHOULD always be based on the institution and its employees. While maintaining the legal framework, it should be analyzed how exactly the employees behave from a security point of view. Based on this, SHOULD investigate where the personal and organizational security can be improved.

#### ORP.2.A12 Designation of separate contact persons (CIA)

To the satisfaction of the coworkers a responsible person SHOULD be named as a trustworthy contact person. In case of major organizational or technical changes, the designation of such a contact person SHOULD be checked.

#### ORP.2.A13 Security Check (CIA)

In the high-security area, an additional security check should be performed to thoroughly verify the trustworthiness of employees.
