### 1.1 Introduction

The staff of a company or authority forms the basis for its or its success or failure. At the same time, employees are an integral part of information security. Experience shows that even the most complex safety precautions without the right behavior of the employees are ineffective. Awareness of what information security means to the institution and its business processes, and the proper treatment of employees with the information to be protected by the institution are therefore essential.

This module deals primarily with the security measures that should be implemented for and by employees of an institution. Starting with the hiring of employees until their departure, a variety of measures is required. In addition, of course, no other groups of people who come into contact with the information of the institution may be forgotten, such as employees of service providers and customers. Also for dealing with external, such. As visitors, cleaning personnel or maintenance technicians, appropriate security measures must be present.

### 1.2 Life cycle

A number of measures have to be implemented for the personnel working in a company or authority, starting with the regular training of new employees, through training, to the regular retirement of an employee. The steps that should be taken and the actions that should be followed in each step are listed below.

**Implementation**

The company or the authority must announce existing regulations and instructions to new employees (see ORP.2.M1 * Regulated training of new employees *), so that they can be quickly integrated into existing processes. It is also essential to educate all employees about changes in these regulations and their specific impact on a process or individual employee. In particular, in safety-critical operating environments, it is advisable to oblige the employees accordingly and to have the trustworthiness of employees confirmed (see ORP.2.M6 * Candidate Selection Check *, ORP.2.M7 * Verification of the trustworthiness of employees *, ORP.2.M5 * Confidentiality Agreements * and ORP.2.M13 * Security Check *). Special emphasis is put on the trustworthiness of persons with special functions and authorizations, such as administrators.

**Business**

The motivation of all employees to accept information security in the operating processes and to implement it on their own responsibility must be motivated and supported by appropriate training and detailed knowledge of the applications at the technical level (see building block ORP.3: * Sensitization and training *).

In order to achieve continuous availability of important processes, it must be ensured that key positions are always filled, if required by the procedures (see ORP.2.M3 * substitution regulations *).

Communication problems, personal problems, bad working environment, far-reaching organizational changes and the like are also factors that can lead to security risks. For such cases, confidants and contact points should be set up (see ORP.2.M12 * Designation of separate contact persons *).

** Function to change **
For employees who leave the institution or assume other functions, existing regulations must be implemented with greater care (see ORP.2.M2 * Regulated procedure for the departure of employees *). In the case of short-term departing employees, there can be a potential risk that unauthorized confidential information is taken along or only afterward targeted manipulation of facilities, IT systems or data is noticed.

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the "Personnel" area.

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### ORP.2.M1 Regulated induction of new employees [supervisors]

Not only do new employees have to be trained in their new tasks, they also need to be informed about internal regulations, practices and procedures. Without proper training, they will not know their contacts on information security issues, they will not know what security measures to take and what security strategy the agency or company is following. This can cause disruption and damage to the institution. Therefore, the regulated training of new employees is of corresponding importance. Experienced employees should be sensitized accordingly, so that they can support new employees and therefore safety problems can be reduced to a minimum in advance. New employees should have an experienced colleague for questions.

The training should at least include the following points:

* All new employees should be instructed in the use of essential IT systems and applications. In addition, all new employees should be sensitized and trained on all relevant safety measures (see also building block ORP.3: Awareness and Training). New employees should have enough time for familiarization.
* All contacts should be introduced, especially those on information security and data protection issues.
* The safety objectives of the authority or the company should be presented to the new employees. All in-house regulations and rules on information security need to be explained. For all types of potential security incidents, the rules of conduct and reporting should be set out. The procedure for completing the training is a roadmap or checklist showing the individual activities and the level of familiarization achieved.
#### ORP.2.M2 Regulated procedure for the departure of employees [supervisors, IT operations]

If an employee leaves the institution or changes function, please note:

* Prior to leaving, a timely briefing of the successor is required. For this it is desirable that the working periods overlap at least briefly.
* The withdrawing party must recover all documents (as well as borrowed library books), keys handed over, borrowed equipment (eg portable computers, storage media, documentation). In particular, the official or company identity cards as well as other cards and access tokens as well as keys for access authorization are to be collected. Furthermore, in biometric procedures (eg iris scanners, fingerprints and hand-back recognition), corresponding access authorizations must be deleted or adapted to the representative regulation.
* All access authorizations and access rights set up for the departing person must be withdrawn or deleted. This also applies to external access authorizations via data transmission facilities. If, in exceptional cases, an access authorization to an IT system has been shared between several persons (eg by means of a common password), the access authorization must be changed after the departure of one of the persons.
* Prior to adoption, it should again be explicitly stated that all confidentiality statements remain in force and that no information received during the work may be disclosed.
* If the departing person is an officer in an emergency plan, the emergency plan must be updated.
* All persons entrusted with security tasks, in particular the porter service, are to be informed about the departure and functional changes of employees.
* Excreted employees must be prevented from uncontrolled access to government or company premises, in particular to rooms with IT systems. Even in the case of functional changes, the access authorization to certain premises such as server rooms may have to be withdrawn.
* Optionally, even for the period between pronouncing a termination and the departure of withdrawal of all access and access rights to IT systems, as well as the prohibition to enter areas worthy of protection, pronounced and technically implemented.
* All necessary activities when an employee leaves the institution or changes function must be clearly regulated. As a practical tool so-called runway have been found on which the individual activities of the departing person are predetermined, which he has to do before leaving the authority or the company.
#### ORP.2.M3 Representation Rules [Supervisors]

Representation regulations have the meaning, for predictable (holiday, business trip) and also unpredictable cases (illness, accident, termination) of the personal loss to enable the continuation of the task perception. Therefore, before such a case has occurred, it must be regulated who represents whom and in which matters and with which competences. This is particularly important in the field of information processing, since this usually requires special knowledge and a timely training of ignorant employees for the substitution case is not possible.

The following boundary conditions must be observed for the substitution regulations:

* For all essential business processes and tasks, viable representation regulations must be in place. These must be updated regularly.
* The assumption of tasks in case of substitution presupposes that the procedural or project status has been sufficiently documented.
* The naming of a representative is usually not sufficient, it must be checked how the representative is to train, so that he can take over the tasks in content. If it turns out that there are people who can not be replaced at short notice because of their special knowledge, their failure means a serious threat to normal operation. Here it is particularly important to train a representative.
* It must be determined which scope of tasks should be performed by whom in the case of substitution.
* The representative may only obtain the necessary access, access and access authorizations in case of substitution.
* If, in exceptional cases, it is not possible to name or train a competent representative for persons, it should be considered at an early stage which external forces can be used for the substitution case.
#### ORP.2.M4 Regulations for the use of external personnel
Often, outside authorities or companies rely on external support if the necessary human resources are not available in-house. In extreme cases, this can lead to external staff being employed in their own home for such long periods of time that many employees no longer know exactly whether they are their own or external employees. Here, it makes sense to oblige both internal and external employees to wear appropriate ID cards.

External employees who work in or for an organization for an extended period of time and who may be able to gain access to confidential records and data must make a written commitment to comply with applicable applicable laws, regulations and internal regulations.

When employing external staff, it must also be ensured that they are assigned to their tasks at the beginning of their work, similar to their own employees. They are to be informed, to the extent necessary to fulfill their duties and obligations, about in-house and information security regulations and organization-wide information security policies. This is particularly true if they work within the properties of the client.

In addition, it should be ensured that substitution regulations also exist for external employees. It should also be ensured that they are familiar with the IT applications they use and that they also have the necessary security measures.

At the end of the contract, a regular handover of the work results and the documents and resources received must take place. In addition, all established access, access and access authorizations and access rights must be withdrawn or deleted. In addition, the person making the withdrawal should be explicitly informed that the obligation to maintain secrecy also remains after the end of the activity.

Third-party personnel to be deployed at short notice or once a single time is to be treated like visitors. D. H. For example, the stay in security-relevant areas is only allowed in the company of employees of the authority or the company.

#### ORP.2.M5 Confidentiality agreements for the use of outside personnel

External employees are often given access to confidential information to perform their tasks, or to receive results that must be kept confidential. In these cases, they must be obliged to treat them accordingly. This should be followed by non-disclosure agreements, signed by external staff.

A confidentiality agreement should describe

* which information must be kept confidential,
* for which period this confidentiality agreement applies,
* what actions must be taken upon termination of this agreement, eg. B. destruction or return of data carriers,
* how the ownership of information is regulated,
* what regulations apply to the use and disclosure of confidential information to other partners, if necessary
* what consequences occur in case of breach of the agreement.
The confidentiality agreement may also refer to the relevant security policies and other policies of the organization. In the event that external employees have access to the organization's IT infrastructure, they should sign the security policies for using the respective IT systems in addition to the confidentiality agreement.
A confidentiality agreement provides the legal basis for obliging external employees to keep information confidential. For this reason, it must take into account all relevant laws and regulations for the organization in the specific area of ​​application, be clearly worded and kept up to date.

It may be useful to use different confidentiality agreements depending on the purpose. In this case, it must be clearly defined which agreement is necessary for which cases.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures correspond to the state of the art in the field of "personnel".

#### ORP.2.M6 Review of candidates in the selection of staff

Already when formulating the requirements, the required qualifications and skills should be precisely described. Whether they actually exist with applicants should first be checked on the basis of the documents, then clarified in the interview.

Individuals who are required to perform security-related tasks (such as security officers, data protection officers, administrators, employees with access to financial or confidential information) must be particularly trustworthy and reliable.

Particular care must be taken to ensure that no conflicts of interest or dependencies arise which endanger the performance of the task. Conflicts of interest can occur, in particular, if an employee has various roles at the same time, which give him far-reaching rights or exclude himself. In addition, the duties of employees should not be affected by conflicts of interest outside the authority or the company, for example as a result of previous posts or other obligations. In order to avoid conflicts of interest after a job change, non-competition and waiting periods can be agreed.

Insofar as the specialist qualifications in some areas are not yet sufficiently available, employees must have the opportunity to expand them. In order to maintain and update the required qualifications and skills, all employees should receive regular training and the importance of information security (see also module ORP.3: * Awareness and Training *).

These points should also be taken into account when selecting temporary or service personnel.

#### ORP.2.M7 Checking the trustworthiness of employees

The possibilities to have the trustworthiness of new or external personnel checked are legally very limited in Germany, but also in many other countries. In addition, the results are usually not very meaningful, such. B. in police certificates. In principle, however, should be checked before the acquisition of new or external employees in projects, whether

* These have sufficient references, eg. From other, similar projects, and
* the submitted curriculum vitae of the candidate is meaningful and complete.
In addition, it may be useful to have academic and professional qualifications certified, for example, by inquiring at the university or from previous employers or clients. The identity of the candidate should also be verified. B. by presentation of identity documents.

If external personnel are deployed internally or can access internal applications and data in projects, collaborations or outsourcing projects, comparable checks should be carried out as for own employees. When drafting contracts with external service providers, it should be contractually stipulated which side has to perform such checks, to what extent these are carried out and how these are documented.

** Selection of trusted administrators **
The IT system or TK system administrators and their representatives must be able to trust the operator with great confidence. They have - depending on the system used - extensive and often all powers. Administrators and their representatives are able to access and, if necessary, modify all stored data and grant permissions in a way that would allow substantial abuse.

Administrators of IT systems and their representatives must be carefully selected. You must be regularly informed that the powers may be used only for the required administrative tasks.

Since the administrator has a key role regarding the functionality of the hardware and software used, the continuation of his activities must be guaranteed even in the event of his failure. For this, the named representatives must have the current state of the system configuration and have access to the passwords, keys and security tokens required for the administration.

If a company or an authority has several administrators with comparable IT system knowledge, they can also represent each other if they still have spare capacity. In all areas in which only one administrator mainly responsible for IT systems care, two deputies should be incorporated, since in case of prolonged absence of the administrator experience has shown that the deputy is temporarily not available for administrative tasks.

In order to ensure the functioning of the IT operation, it must be checked, in particular in the event of pending personnel changes or changes in the organizational structure, whether the required administrative activities can also be managed by the designated administrators and their representatives.

Especially in the case of imminent relocations, administration tasks at another location can lead to a considerable increase in the workload of the administrators. Even in such cases, it must be ensured that the production plant at the previous location is not affected until the time of the move.

#### ORP.2.M8 Tasks and Responsibilities of Employees [Information Security Officer (ISB)]

The duties and responsibilities of employees must be documented appropriately, for example through employment contracts or agreements. Among other things, the authorizations that employees receive for handling information and IT systems are derived from this. When assigning tasks and responsibilities, employees should also be made directly aware of security-relevant aspects, such as which information may be passed on to which internal or external contact person and under what conditions, such as: B. encryption this has to be done.

This also means that employees know that they have a responsibility for information security outside of working hours and outside the premises.

The Information Security Officer must ensure that all employees know their responsibilities and responsibilities in the security process. For this purpose, he can clarify, for example, with the HR department or the technical superiors, whether the corresponding processes ensure this.

#### ORP.2.M9 Training of employees
Employees should be regularly trained according to their job so that they are always up-to-date with the work assigned to them. This is particularly important in the field of IT administration and maintenance of information technology, as the fastest changes occur in this area. But also in all other areas, it should be ensured that no employee pursues his or her job based on an outdated state of knowledge. Furthermore, the employees should be given the opportunity during their employment, to further develop within the scope of their field of activity.

All employees must be trained in the equipment, applications, and activities that are used to safely process information, such as shredders, encryption programs, or authentication tokens. In addition, all employees should receive regular training in information security and be informed about everyday risks and possible countermeasures. Employees should also be motivated to implement information security regulations on their own responsibility. If there is a need for more training, it may be useful to train individual employees separately and use them within the area of ​​activity as multipliers for the remaining employees in order to minimize possible downtimes through training.

This topic is covered in detail in the module ORP.3: * Awareness and Training.

#### ORP.2.M10 Avoidance of disturbances of the working environment

A positive working atmosphere motivates employees on the one hand to comply with safety measures, on the other hand it reduces the risk of negligent or intentional acts that can disturb the operation. Disturbances of the working environment can have a variety of internal and external causes, but often occur in serious internal changes. Examples of such changes include restructuring, reorganization, sale or merger of organizational units and outsourcing projects. These can have a negative effect on the working climate as they usually cause fears of different kinds (eg loss of competence, fear of failure, loss of job). These can be better dealt with if the working climate is as good as possible even before the changes.

From a safety perspective, attempts should therefore be made to achieve a positive working atmosphere and to maintain it permanently. The multitude of possibilities can not be cited here, so here only a selection of possible measures is mentioned whose suitability and feasibility should be examined in detail:

* Establishment of a social space,
* Avoiding overtime,
* Avoidance of large residual holiday entitlements,
* Observance of break times,
* regulated distribution of tasks,
* even workload,
* fair pay,
* existing representative system.
Communication problems in an organization almost inevitably lead to security problems. In extreme cases, this can lead to deliberate security breaches. If users find security measures merely "annoying" because they have not been informed of their purpose, it may already lead to their being bypassed.

Also the transmission of bad news must be possible, without the messenger therefore has to fear sanctions. There should be a working atmosphere in which it is possible for each person concerned to report security incidents within their own company or their own authority. Only in this way can existing security deficits be addressed effectively and openly.

Employees can not only be motivated by financial incentives. Above all, the recognition of their work performance is important. Employees should be involved in decisions wherever possible.
At the very least, they should be informed about the reasons for making the decisions so that they actively and motivatedly participate in their implementation.

Often z. B. Protesting the selection of certain hardware or software in that the users try to show that the enforced hardware or software is not as secure as their preferred one.

The working atmosphere and the behavior of employees can be of particular importance in the case of major changes, such as outsourcing projects: dissatisfied or angry employees can cause such a project to fail (eg dismissal of know-how carriers in critical areas) Phases of change or deliberate ignoring of safety instructions), which can be life-threatening for the company in succession. For major restructuring or outsourcing projects, the following aspects are recommended:

* Employees should be involved early in decision-making processes such as the selection of an outsourcing service provider. In the further course of the project they should be involved in the design of possible takeover agreements.
* Employees should be fully informed about changes at an early stage and have a point of contact for problems and questions. Indirect information through the media, e.g. For example, via newspapers, instead of direct by the company or government management creates distrust, destroys the basis of trust and prepares speculation and rumors the ground.
* In the case of organizational changes, the employees concerned should be given future prospects. Often outsourcing service providers are dependent on the highest possible proportion of employees in the outsourced area switching to them. Only in this way can a satisfactory quality of service be guaranteed. Employees who are worried about the future or who feel treated unfairly decline in their quality of work or even leave the company prematurely.
* Demanding or burdensome activities, which can not be avoided in the context of restructuring, should be adequately acknowledged and recognized. The extra work required should be rewarded.
### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ORP.2.M11 Safety Culture Analysis (CIA)

One of the most important pillars of information security in an institution is its staff. Experience shows that even the most elaborate technical safety measures are worthless without the proper behavior of the employees. An awareness of what information security means for the institution and its business processes, and the proper treatment of employees with the information to be protected by the institution are essential.

The security measures selected for the institution should therefore always be based on the employees. Their knowledge and handling of information and IT should be included. Therefore, it makes sense to analyze the various factors that contribute to how employees behave from a security perspective. Building on this, it can then be examined where personal and organizational security can be improved, for example through awareness-raising and information security training.

The following aspects should be examined:

** ** safety culture
The term safety culture encompasses the safety-related attitudes, values ​​and basic beliefs of an institution and all its employees. The culture of safety also includes how open the handling of information security issues is lived in the institution. For example, a trustworthy and open communication culture is important for the effective and efficient handling of security incidents, so that security incidents can be immediately reported on and solution-oriented addressed.

* What is the dealings in the agency or the company with business-related information and risks in general? Is the institution more risk-oriented or risk-avoidant? Is information given more freely or restrictively?
* What are the requirements for accuracy and precision? Are minor errors tolerable in texts, for example, because they still have to go through several tuning processes anyway? Can an input error already lead to serious damage?
* What are the requirements for availability? Are there a lot of tight deadlines? Can processing times for inquiries and business processes be set flexibly? Are minor missed deadlines or changes generally acceptable or do they lead to harsh consequences?
The security culture of an institution is strongly influenced by the industry in which it operates. In high-security areas, information is naturally less openly handled than in research institutions.

** knowledge and ability **

* How well do employees know about IT? Is IT and Internet use more of a necessity to make business processes more effective, or is life and work unimaginable without IT and the Internet?
* What experience and knowledge do employees have about information security and privacy? What are their capabilities for IT-based security measures such as encryption? How is the knowledge distributed in the different areas of the institution?
* What is the way employees interact with information security and privacy issues? How do employees view the need to protect information from change or unauthorized disclosure?
* Can employees actively contribute their information security ideas and ideas to the security process?
** Security Policies **

* Do the security policies of the institution match the business processes and internal security culture? Are they easy to implement? Are they practical and adapted to the current environmental conditions? Do they interfere with work processes? Do they support desirable behaviors?
** Applications and IT **

* Do existing IT components enable you to deal with business-related information that meets both your protection needs and your security requirements?
** managerial level **

* What is the management level regarding information security? Do superiors act as role models? Are there management wishes to improve security processes?
** Cultural Backgrounds **

* The cultural background can also influence the handling of information to be protected and security requirements in general. Therefore, it should be examined whether there are regional and national differences in information security management. Above all, it should also be explored what different approaches to information security exist in the different areas of the institution. Even individual departments can already develop their own rules and behavior when dealing with business-relevant information.
** Changes **

* All kinds of far-reaching changes for employees can change their way of handling information, business processes and IT. These include, for example, restructuring, dismissals, changes of tasks or superiors.
If the analysis shows that employees behave differently than it makes sense from a security point of view, there are various ways to deal with it. It can, for. For example, try to change the behavior (see ORP.3: * Awareness and Training *). On the other hand, in many cases it may be simpler to redesign security policies or workflows because behavioral changes can only be achieved in the long run. It should be noted that the protection requirements are taken into account unchanged by appropriate security requirements or measures implemented.

#### ORP.2.M12 Designation of separate contact persons (CIA)

Inadequate job performance can often be the result of a worker's personal problems. For example, high debts, addictions but also difficulties in the workplace (over- / under-demands, mobbing) can be listed as problems. In many cases, helping a person to overcome these problems can be helpful if a trusted person is available. This contact person should both have an eye on the interests of the person concerned and offer concrete assistance as well as safeguard the interests of the company or authority and seek solutions together with the person concerned.

However, supervisors and colleagues must also be able to turn to this trusted person if repeated abnormalities have been noticed by third parties which indicate a reduced reliability. The confidant must then have the opportunity to contact the person concerned and offer help.

Such a position may be staff council, works council, occupational physicians. The establishment of such a contact point is to be announced to all employees. External agencies are, for example, the counseling centers of the statutory health insurance funds.

#### ORP.2.M13 Security Check (CIA)

The possibilities to have the trustworthiness of new or external personnel checked are legally very limited in Germany, but also in many other countries. In addition, the results are usually not very meaningful, such. B. in police certificates. In the high-security domain, the basic verification of employees' trustworthiness may not be sufficient. Here an additional security check should be performed.
