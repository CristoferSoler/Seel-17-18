### 1.1 Introduction

Teleworkers, freelancers or the self-employed typically work from home-based workplaces. In contrast to the workplace in an office environment, employees at a home workplace * * use a workplace in their own living environment. It must be made possible that the professional sphere is sufficiently separated from the private sphere. If employees permanently use domestic workplaces, various legal requirements must also be fulfilled, for example they must comply with occupational health and ergonomic regulations.

A home-based workplace can not assume the same infrastructural security as is found in the offices of an institution. For example, often the workplace is also accessible to visitors or family members. Therefore, measures must be taken to achieve a level of security comparable to an office space.

### 1.2 Life cycle

** planning and conception **

If employees are allowed to work from home * *, the workplace must be planned and designed. It should be set up in such a way that a level of security adequate to the planned activity is achieved in the same way as the office environment (see INF.8.M4 * Appropriate Home Workplace *).

**Business**

The home workplace should always be locked in such a way that it is as free of burglary as possible (see INF.8.M3 * Protection against unauthorized access to the home workplace *). Also, official documents and data carriers should be locked away and not lying around openly (see INF.8.M1 * Securing official documents at the domestic workplace *) *. *

How and which work materials can be transported back and forth between the home workplace and the institution must also be regulated (see INF.8.M2 * Transport of work materials to the home workplace *) *. *

** ** segregation

Especially at the home workplace, it is important to dispose of data media and printouts carefully and not to throw them in the household waste (see INF.8.M5 * Disposal of confidential information at the home workplace *).

2 measures
-----------

The following is a list of specific implementation notes in the Home Workplace area.

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### INF.8.M1 Securing official documents at the home office

Every employee should be encouraged to leave their domestic workplaces tidy. Employees in the home environment must ensure that unauthorized persons can not access IT applications, data, data media or documents. All employees must review their workplaces and ensure that sensitive information is not freely accessible, so that the availability, confidentiality and integrity of data can not be adversely affected.

If an employee only briefly leaves the home office during working hours, it is sufficient to lock the room if possible and / or to lock the screen in such a way that access is only possible after successful authentication. If a room can not be closed, sensitive documents should be locked even in the case of a short absence. If an employee is absent for a longer period of time, for example when traveling on business or on vacation, he has to clean up his workplace in such a way that no data carriers or documents needing protection are left undocked. For this, the employees need sufficiently dimensioned and lockable storage options, such. B. safe roll containers with locks.

Also, passwords should never be stored easily (eg on an adhesive label on the monitor or under the desk pad). Also, no trivial passwords should be used.
Safety management supervisors and staff should advise employees that they need to properly clean up their domestic workplaces.

#### INF.8.M2 Transportation of work material to the home workplace [Home automation]

For official tasks to be carried out at a home office, all necessary information must be available there. Files, data media and other documents must be transported safely. This is the way to regulate how data carriers and documents are exchanged between the home office and the institution. The following points should therefore be considered or regulated at least:

* Which files, data carriers and documents may be exchanged via which transport route (eg postal route, courier, parcel service)?
* What protective measures should be observed during transport?

 
+ It also includes selecting suitable packaging.
+ Information on digital media must be encrypted before being transported.


 
* Which files, data media and documents may only be transported personally?
Since documents, documents and files are often unique, when choosing a suitable exchange procedure the possible damage in the event of loss must be taken into account. If possible and permissible, copies should be made prior to media exchange.

All affected employees must be aware of how to transport and protect files and media.

#### INF.8.M3 Protection against unauthorized access to the home workplace [Home automation]

Institutions must regulate what employees need to do to protect their home-based workplace from unauthorized access. The rules are to be made known to the employees in a suitable form.

Depending on the circumstances of the home, appropriate measures must be established to ensure that roommates or visitors can not access official IT and documents at any time. These measures must be checked at reasonable intervals, but at least when domestic circumstances change.

To protect against unauthorized access to the home workplace z. For example, the following points should be noted:

* Interior and exterior doors must be locked in times when a home office is not occupied. This prevents unauthorized persons from accessing documents and IT equipment located therein. This is particularly important when domestic workplaces are located in areas with public access or access is not controlled by other means.
* Similarly, windows and outward doors (balconies, terraces) must be closed in times when a home office is not occupied. In the cellar and ground floor and, depending on the design of the façade, also on the higher floors, open windows and doors offer burglars ideal entry points, which can also be used during the working hours of the domestic employee.
* Doors with a blind knob on the side of the corridor do not need to be completed. The prerequisite for this, however, is that the authorized employees always carry their key to the home office with them.
* When the computer is running, it is not necessary to lock the door if the employee only leaves the workstation for a short time and the PC can only be accessed after successful authentication. When the computer is switched off, the office can remain open if the computer can only be booted with the help of a password. The same function is fulfilled by access mechanisms based on tokens or smart cards. If documents are to be protected at the workplace, the door should be closed.
Together with the basic measures, the following measures are in line with the state of the art in the field of home work.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures are in line with the state of the art in the field of home work.

#### INF.8.M4 Adequate home-work equipment [Home automation]

When choosing a home-based workplace, it must be ensured that it can be set up appropriately, meets ergonomic requirements and that necessary measures for burglary protection are available or can be retrofitted.

**Facility**

For the home office, a private study is desirable. At the very least, the home office workstation should be detachable from the rest of the home with a lockable door so that documents and IT systems located there are located outside the areas where other residents, relatives or visitors may reside. In the case of spontaneous visits, the workplace can be left at short notice and protected against unauthorized access.

The equipment should be selected taking into account ergonomics, safety and health. This means among other things:

* enough space for furniture and VDU workplace,
* adjustable room temperature and adequate ventilation options,
* Shielding against noise sources,
* Daylight and sufficient artificial lighting,
Screen privacy of the monitor if it could be seen through a window
* Avoidance of annoying glare, reflections or reflections in the workplace and
* Connections for telephone and electricity.
Office IT should be provided by the employer to enforce security policies. Only then can z. For example, it can be ruled out by a service order that the IT is used for private purposes.

At home workplaces, the same rules and guidelines regarding the design of the workplace and work environment must be observed as in the institution. A home-based job must therefore be adequately equipped for the tasks involved, ie. H. not only does it have to have suitable furniture, but adequate safeguards, such as lockable cabinets, should also be available.

Employees with a home-based workplace should be regularly asked if the workplace meets their health and operational needs. Random verification visits by the institution should only be carried out if previously agreed with the employee.

** Security **

Experience has shown that burglars select their goals according to how high the risk and effort in relation to the expected profit. Therefore, all anti-burglary measures at home should aim to minimize perpetrators' chances of success. The existing security measures at the home workplace * * may already be sufficient. If this is not the case, the usual anti-intrusion measures must be adapted to local conditions and the existing protection requirements. These include, for example:

* burglary-resistant doors and windows, for example with resistance class RC2 (according to DIN EN 1627: 2011-09 "Doors, windows, curtain walls, grille elements and closures - burglar resistance - requirements and classification") or higher if the hazardous situation makes it necessary
* Blinds on entry-level doors or windows,
* special lock cylinders, additional locks and latches,
* if necessary securing of basement light shafts,
* Closure of unused side entrances.
Recommendations can be made by the local counseling centers of the Criminal Police.
During planning, during implementation and later during operation, a qualified person should regularly assess whether the protection against burglary is consistent and that any possible attempts to overcome it are met with equivalent resistance.

Employees at the home workplace must be notified of the regulations and measures for burglary protection, eg doors, windows or shutters must be locked in the evening (see also INF.8.M3 * Protection against unauthorized access to the home workplace *).

It can also make sense to install anti-burglary elements directly at the home workplace, for example in the case of an increased need for protection.

** Ergonomic workplace **

The burden of permanent work on poorly equipped domestic workplaces should not be underestimated as it can lead to health problems. An ergonomic workplace can reduce these loads. Improved ergonomics also means a more effective way of working. This not only brings health benefits to the worker, but also results in more economical work and improved implementation of safety measures.

Therefore, every workplace should be ergonomically designed. For computer workstations, for example, chair, table, screen and keyboard must be individually adjustable in order to enable the most error-free operation of the IT and promote. This includes, among other things, that the backrest, seat height and seat of the chair must be adjustable, but also that the work equipment can be arranged so that for each work task the least possible load.

The IT systems used at home, especially the screen, must also be ergonomically positioned. For example, the screen should always be placed at right angles to the window to avoid direct exposure to light. In addition, an undisturbed work should be possible on IT systems. Domestic workers should not be able to keep a constant eye on other people. This can also prevent information being viewed without authorization.

An appropriately equipped workplace also makes it easier to comply with safety measures. If trays, documentation, documents and accessories are to be included, there must be lockable desks or cabinets.

#### INF.8.M5 Disposal of confidential information at the home workplace [Home automation]

Equipment or material at the home office (eg printer paper, USB hard disks, DVDs, USB sticks, SD cards, but also special toner cartridges) will eventually no longer be needed or need to be sorted out. If they contain sensitive data, they must be disposed of in such a way that no conclusions can be drawn about previously stored data. For functional data carriers, the data should be deleted securely. Non-functioning data carriers or write-once data carriers must be mechanically destroyed (see also CON.6 * Deleting and destruction *).

A specific security policy should regulate how safe materials should be disposed of. If necessary, the necessary disposal facilities must be available at the domestic workplace, eg. B. Shredder.

It is also possible to have the equipment worthy of protection collected by the employee at the home workplace and to provide the disposal facilities at the institution's location for disposal.

If sensitive material is collected for later disposal, it must be securely closed and protected against unauthorized access.
Insofar as no environmentally sound and safe disposal can be carried out in the institution, contracted service providers shall be obliged to comply with the required safety measures. A model contract can be found under the IT Baseline Protection tools on the BSI websites [MVED]. It should be checked regularly by the institution as to whether the disposal process of the contracted service providers is reliable.

### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### INF.8.M6 Dealing with official documents in case of increased protection at home [Information Security Officer (ISB)] (CIA)

If employees are required to work with official documents for which there is an increased need for protection, consideration should be given to whether it is not possible to predict a home-based job. However, if it is indispensable, anti-theft devices suitable for protection purposes should be used for the storage of official documents and lockable cabinets, safes, roll containers and desks in order to properly close away the official records.

The official documents and data carriers with increased protection requirements may only be accessible to authorized persons at the home workplace. Outside the period of use, they must be stored in such a way that no unauthorized person can access them.

In order to meet the requirements, the employees at the home workplace must be advised that documents and data carriers with increased protection requirements must be kept locked.

The locks of the lockable cabinets, roll containers and desks must at least withstand attacks with easy-to-make or easy-to-acquire locking means (paper clip, lockpick, etc.). Furniture locks with at least four tumblers and at least 1000 locking variants should be used. In addition, make sure that the closure can not be easily avoided, for. B. by a backplane is removed. Overall, the protective effect of the container should comply with the safety requirements of the documents and data carriers to be kept therein.

At home workplaces, therefore, adequate lockable containers (desk, roll container, cabinet, safe) with adequate protective effect must be available for the protection and space requirements.

In order to increase the protection of data carriers and IT systems with confidential information, they should also be secured in the home environment in such a way that attackers can not simply take them with them, for example with anti-theft devices.

3 Further information
------------------------------

### 3.1 Worth knowing

Depending on the industry, the technology used or other framework conditions, additional (user-defined) requirements may arise for an information network. These may include, for example, the following measures.

One of the most important pillars of information security in an institution is its staff. Even the most elaborate technical safety precautions are worthless without the proper behavior of the employees. An awareness of what information security means for the institution and its business processes, and the proper treatment of employees with the values ​​and information of the institution to protect are essential for this.
The security measures selected for the institution should therefore always be based on the employees. Their knowledge and handling of information and IT should be included. To assess how people behave from a safety perspective, the factors contributing to this behavior can be analyzed. Building on this, we can examine where personal and organizational security can be improved, for example through awareness-raising and information security training.

The following aspects should be considered:

*** *** safety culture

The term safety culture encompasses the safety-related attitudes, values ​​and fundamental convictions of an institution and all its employees. The culture of safety also includes how open the handling of information security issues is lived in the institution. For example, a trustworthy and open communication culture is important for the effective and efficient handling of security incidents, so that security incidents can be immediately reported on and solution-oriented addressed.

* What is the dealings in the agency or the company with business-related information and risks in general? Is the institution more risk-oriented or risk-avoidant? Is information given more freely or restrictively?
* What are the requirements for accuracy and precision? Are minor errors tolerable in texts, for example, because they still have to go through several tuning processes anyway? Can an input error already lead to serious damage? What are the requirements for availability? Are there a lot of tight deadlines? Can processing times for inquiries and business processes be set flexibly? Are minor missed deadlines or changes generally acceptable or do they lead to harsh consequences?
* What are the requirements for availability? Are there a lot of tight deadlines? Can processing times for inquiries and business processes be set flexibly? Are minor missed deadlines or changes generally acceptable or do they lead to harsh consequences?
The security culture of an institution is strongly influenced by the industry in which it operates. In high-security areas, information is naturally less openly handled than in research institutions.

*** knowledge and skills ***

* How well do employees know about IT? Is IT and Internet use more of a necessity to make business processes more effective, or is life and work unimaginable without IT and the Internet?
* What experience and knowledge do employees have about information security and privacy? What are their capabilities for IT-based security measures such as encryption? How is the knowledge distributed in the different areas of the institution?
* What is the way employees interact with information security and privacy issues? How do employees view the need to protect information from change or unauthorized disclosure, and can employees actively contribute their information security ideas and ideas to the security process?
* Can employees actively contribute their information security ideas and ideas to the security process?
*** *** Security Policies

* Do the security policies of the institution match the business processes and internal security culture? Are they easy to implement? Are they practical and adapted to the current environmental conditions? Do they interfere with work processes? Do they support desirable behaviors?
*** Applications and IT ***

* Do the existing IT, ICS, and IoT components handle the business-relevant information that meets their protection needs and security requirements?
*** *** management level
* What is the management level regarding information security? Do superiors fulfill their role model function? Are there management wishes to improve security processes?
*** Cultural Backgrounds ***

* The cultural background can also influence the handling of information to be protected and security requirements in general. Therefore, it should be examined whether there are regional and national differences in information security management. Above all, it should also be explored what different approaches to information security exist in the different areas of the institution. Even individual departments can already develop their own rules and behavior when dealing with business-relevant information.
*** Changes ***

* All kinds of far-reaching changes for employees can change their way of handling information, business processes, IT and other devices. These include, for example, restructuring, dismissals, changes of tasks or superiors.
If the analysis reveals that employees behave differently than it makes sense from a security point of view, there are several ways to deal with it. It can, for. For example, try to change the behavior. On the other hand, in many cases it may be easier to redesign the security policies or workflows and make them more secure.

Those responsible for awareness-raising and training programs should clarify whether and to what extent they want to use their own staff or external providers as trainers. In addition, the form of training must be determined. If a program includes several awareness-raising and training activities, a training coordinator should be appointed. In addition, various offers from training providers should have been compared, which are the best in terms of content, quality and price. The awareness-raising or training activities carried out should be evaluated by the participants and regularly evaluated internally.

If one's own employees are to be used as trainers, they must have the necessary specialist knowledge and be able to convey this knowledge in a target group-oriented manner. In addition to the required information security knowledge, trainers must have strong didactic, methodological and communication skills. In particular, awareness-raising activities require sufficient knowledge of the institution, its safety culture and business processes. It is important that coaches master the language of their respective target audience, ie be able to put the information security aspects to be trained in the respective work and project contexts. Internal trainers need to get the time they need to not only do awareness-raising and training, but also prepare and evaluate it.

For cost or qualification reasons, it may be more advantageous, at least initially, to have the training carried out by external specialists. Already in the planning phase it has to be clarified which financial resources are available for it. The external trainers should be carefully selected based on content, quality and price criteria and prepared for their task. In particular, they must be provided with the necessary institutional background.

External resources for awareness-raising or training also require internal resources. It should be named a responsible training coordinator who

* selects qualified training providers,
* Provides learning content and methods, as well as providing the trainers with the information they need
* coordinates internal training planning, preparation and implementation,
* forms the communication interface between trainers and own employees,
* Analyzes participant assessments and identifies appropriate improvement measures, if necessary together with the trainers.
The training coordination can be carried out by the information security officer or even an employee from the human resources department. The Information Security Officer and the Human Resources Department must work closely together in any case.

Experience has shown that there are a number of external providers who offer appropriate awareness-raising or training in a form that meets the needs of the institution or that can be adapted with reasonable effort.

In awareness-raising or training activities that aim to reach more employees in several cycles, it is worthwhile thinking about a "train the trainer" concept. Here, the initial measures are carried out either by suitable internal staff or external trainers with the aim that the participants of these measures later take on a coaching role themselves. This can have a very positive effect on their own awareness and motivation for information security for these employees. In addition, they can contribute their own experiences to the training measures. Especially with training topics that include aspects of culture and certain behaviors within the institution, an internal trainer can increase the acceptance and learning of the training because of his deeper knowledge of internal processes and awareness of the participants. Insofar as the "train the trainer" concept is to be used, the initial measures must include, in addition to the intended specialist content, instructions on methodical and didactic teaching.

The awareness-raising or training activities should be finalized by the participants. These experiences should be regularly evaluated internally.

Many safety trainings perceive participants as dry, which has a negative impact on the desired learning effect. A good way to relax the curriculum is plan or role play. Participants usually remember such games longer and more succinctly than classical slide presentations. They also help to make the threats clearer and to highlight typical weaknesses as well as possible solutions in one's own working environment. They enable the participants to practice situations in order to act more routinely in an emergency. It should be examined whether the remaining awareness and training content can be supported by the use of simulation games.

Simulation games can be made of practical examples, eg. For example, based on recent events from the media, or compiled themselves or commissioned from training service providers. The contents of the simulation games should be adapted to the own institution as far as possible. This allows employees to better identify with the solutions shown. By simulating z. For example, in security incidents that can interfere with business-critical processes, employees are well-prepared in the event of an emergency.

As with training courses, the target group content planning is very important in these formats. The participants should be able to recognize the relevance of role-playing games and be able to benefit directly in their work environment.

All efforts to make employees aware of the importance of information security should preserve a positive and constructive mood. Constant fear of security incidents can on the one hand lead to the suppression of security problems and on the other hand to panic reactions.
The following examples show that simulation games can range from very easy-to-implement training exercises to complex simulation exercises. The task of the responsible planners is now to develop suitable scenarios according to the requirements of the different target groups.

* Carrying employee IDs *

Short role-playing games allow employees to practice very well how to behave when they encounter people outside the organization within the institution. It can be practiced how the employees can optimally react to this situation, for example by offering to accompany the external parties to the interlocutor. Also, dealing with visitors who know the house rules, but refuse, can be trained, for example, if a visitor refuses to carry an ID card, because he is personally acquainted with the CEO.

* Social *

In simulations, employees can practice how to behave in social engineering attacks. For this purpose, the selected target groups such. For example, IT supervisors and various groups of administrators are faced with supposedly harmless requests in a joint simulation. Only through the interdisciplinary consideration of these requests it becomes clear that there is an attack here. The aim of the simulation is to find out these relationships through appropriate exercises in order to then be able to react in a defined manner. This type of simulation can be done very well in practice through workshops with moderation materials such as pin board and moderation cards.

* Simulation exercises *

Particularly important are simulations in which the treatment of security incidents up to emergencies is practiced. They should enable employees to perceive assigned roles and responsibilities within a scenario even under difficult conditions (tension, accumulation of instructions, unclear or often changing circumstances, lack of resources, communication problems, etc.) as safely as possible. The goal of simulations is primarily to train personal abilities using representative scenarios that can then be used in as many incidents as possible. Therefore, a simulation should be led by an experienced trainer, who discusses and deepens their experiences in a review with the participants.

In the conception of awareness-raising and training programs, the provision of teaching aids is important, since only permanently present knowledge leads to the desired behavioral changes. After awareness-raising and training activities, participants are usually equipped with a lot of new knowledge and skills. If they do not retrieve or apply this knowledge after the event, they may forget it in whole or in part. In order to permanently improve the awareness of information security among employees, the content of awareness-raising and training should be regularly repeated or applied. This is supported by the Syllabus, which should be carried out both during the course, at the end of a course and thereafter.

The selection of measures to secure teaching material must be coordinated with the respective organizational culture and size.

Examples of measures for teaching material safety are:

* written or oral tests during the training and / or graduation
* Quiz questionnaires with learning opportunities on training content
* Intranet-based surveys on the content of the training courses
* Use of team meetings etc. to discuss current aspects of information security
* Implementation of planned or role-playing games (see ORP.3.M11 Implementation of Information Security Planning Games)
* regular repetition of seminars
* short notes in the intranet supplementing short lectures, z. Eg in the context of other internal events
* additional short lectures, eg Eg in the context of other internal events
