### 1.1 Introduction

Nowadays more and more institutions are deciding not to perform their own processes and activities, but outsource them to an external service provider. This decision is usually made because of the many possibilities that such an outsourcing project can bring. Depending on the existing framework conditions, costs may be saved, external resources used flexibly, or a reduction in their own resources may be achieved in order to focus more on one's own core competencies. However, these opportunities are always accompanied by risks that are sometimes considerable (high dependence on external service providers, loss of control and control and information security risks), which not only cause an outsourcing service to fail, but in the worst case also the existence of outsourcing Endanger institution. It is therefore all the more important to adequately address any risks associated with the outsourcing service. In order to be able to implement this objective appropriately, close cooperation between the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer is essential. The success of the outsourcing project is not only in the interest of the outsourcing institution. Rather, the outsourcing service provider also has a great interest in ensuring that the customer's outsourcing goals are met to their fullest satisfaction. Failure to meet the requirements of the service provider can sometimes result in high penalties and other legal implications that not only have a significant financial impact on the service provider, but can also seriously damage its reputation.

Due to these risks, measures are described below that the outsourcing service provider should consider or implement during each phase of an outsourcing service.

### 1.2 Life cycle

In order to realize an outsourcing service, both the outsourcing body and the outsourcing service provider have to implement a series of measures to ensure the proper course and thus the success of an outsourcing service. Starting with the creation of a rough concept for the outsourcing service, the contract design with the outsourcing customer up to the safe migration and the transition into the regular enterprise, a multiplicity of security risks is to be met thereby. In the following, from the point of view of the service provider, the steps of outsourcing and their individual measures are listed.

** planning and conception **

In order to promote the success of an outsourcing service, it is important for the service provider as well as the customer, in advance of the actual outsourcing, to coordinate and define all necessary framework conditions for the joint project. The rough concept for the outsourcing service is the basis for this (see OPS.3.1.M1 Creation of a rough concept for the outsourcing service). Individual and general risks associated with the respective outsourcing service must be identified and their treatment coordinated with the customer.

**Implementation**

In order to ensure that services are provided in accordance with the requirements, agreements such as service descriptions and safety requirements etc. must be contractually agreed in advance (see OPS.3.1.M2 Contract design with the outsourcing customer). In addition, the security requirements of the customer throughout the outsourcing process should be met and the resources required should be kept (see, among others, OPS.3.1.M3 Creation of a security concept for the outsourcing service, OPS.3.2.M13 ** ** Secure Migration for outsourcing projects) **. **

**Business**
In addition to the continuous provision of services in accordance with the contractually stipulated Service Level Agreements (SLAs), a safety culture coordinated with the customer must be lived out for the entire operating phase. This must be ensured by a regular and event-based exchange of information and regular monitoring of the implementation and effectiveness of agreed security measures (OPS.3.1.M10 Planning and maintaining information security in ongoing outsourcing operations).

** ** segregation

In addition, preparations must be made for a planned or unplanned termination of the outsourcing service so that the outsourced processes can be properly returned or transferred to a third party (see OPS.3.1.M15 Orderly Termination of Outsourcing Ratio).

** Emergency Preparedness **

When drafting the contract, the essential aspects of emergency preparedness must be discussed and contractually agreed (see OPS.3.1.M2 contract design with the outsourcing customer). The exact regulations should be worked out between the two contracting parties in an emergency preparedness concept, coordinated with each other and regularly checked and tested (see OPS.3.1.M14 Emergency Preparedness for Outsourcing).

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the area "Outsourcing for service providers".

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### OPS.3.1.M1 Creation of a rough concept for the outsourcing service

The outsourcing service provider, together with the outsourcing customer, must define in a rough concept possible interaction processes, rules and guidelines on which the cooperation is based. It defines outsourcing management with leadership and control functions, as well as interfaces between the parties and other processes (eg, emergency management, information security, and privacy) to transparently map transparent outsourcing governance and respond quickly to events enable.

The concept should also include consideration of the following factors:

** Objectives of the outsourcing project **

It has to be defined which opportunities and goals the outsourcing customer associates with the project, which added value should be created and how the project's success can be measured. In this way, specific, measurable and realistic goals are to be achieved in a predefined time frame. In order to be able to make a statement as to whether the outsourcing service is successful, the outsourcing service provider's performance vis-à-vis the outsourcing customer must be comprehensible.

In particular, the objectives of an outsourcing project must take into account the information security objectives. To be able to measure these goals so-called security service level agreements are suitable. These should be fixed in writing in the security concept and checked at regular intervals.

For the outsourcing service provider, it is in any case of interest to participate in the definition of these measured variables, as this is intended to measure the quality of its service provision.

Possible measures for quantifiable performance evaluations could be:

* Milestones of the outsourcing project (eg planning, migration, operation)
* Security Level Agreements (eg information on availability)
** Qualities of the outsourcing service provider **

The requirements for the services provided by the outsourcing service providers are user-specific and individual. A preliminary consideration of the expectations of the outsourcing customer, eg. For example, in terms of capacity and availability of services, may avoid misunderstandings prior to commencing contract negotiations.
The outsourcing service provider should ideally be able to present qualities to the outsourcing customer. To the qualities of an outsourcing service provider can z. These include, for example, a valid ISMS certification that already covers the scope of the outsourcing customer. But also reference customers, which the outsourcing customer can contact before signing the contract if necessary, may be useful to present their own qualities in dealing with information security.

** dependencies on external third parties **

In a complex networked business world with a high degree of specialization many dependencies exist. As a rule, the outsourcing service provider also uses other third parties to B. Have maintenance performed on different systems. These dependencies should be communicated to the outsourcing customer by the outsourcing service provider before the contract is signed.

These interdependencies in service provision should be presented in the necessary depth of detail in order to be able to record possible risks and handle them accordingly. An interruption of the service provision by the outsourcing service provider can result in serious penalties and damage the reputation. In addition, open communication about potential risks is the basis of a successful outsourcing relationship.

By the outsourcing service provider z. To represent:

* Critical business processes outsourced to third parties
 

 
+ In particular existing IT outsourcing contracts
+ External data management (service provider, location [e])


 
* Telecommunications provider
* Cooperation with third parties in connection with emergency preparedness (eg alternative workplaces)
** ** safety culture

An important factor in a long-term commitment as part of an outsourcing service is the consideration of the different safety cultures. For this purpose, the security culture of both the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer should be considered in a reflective manner. For example:

* Socio-cultural differences and similarities that also shape the organizational culture
* Company values ​​and visions
* Leadership and Decision Styles
* Formal and informal social codes
* Ethical standards
* Attitude to risks, risk appetite
In particular, the secure handling of data and information by the employees of the outsourcing service provider should be clearly regulated. The outsourcing customer relies first and foremost on the reliability of the outsourcing service provider when selecting their employees. The outsourcing service provider should therefore pay attention to the working environment in the respective teams when assigning tasks to employees.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures correspond to the state of the art in the field of outsourcing for service providers.

#### OPS.3.1.M2 Contract Design with Outsourcing Customers [ISB Outsourcing Service Provider]

When designing outsourcing contracts, it is important to consider all aspects of an outsourced contracting process through so-called service level agreements (SLAs) and, together with the outsourcing client, to closely analyze the tasks and processes to be undertaken to perform. All features not defined in advance usually result in additional costs, especially for outsourcing customers. This damages the business relationship between the contracting parties and weakens the negotiating position of the outsourcing service provider in case of contract extensions.
In order to take this into account, it is advisable to take into account and define as accurately as possible all relevant service descriptions for the outsourcing service in the contract. This is particularly important in that any discrepancies between the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer with regard to different concepts of service provision in the course of the outsourcing project can be prevented in advance. In the event of unlawful allegations on the part of the outsourcing customer with regard to a service that is not or not sufficiently performed, the outsourcing customer may refer to the corresponding service description within the framework of the contract.

The type, scope and level of detail of the contractual arrangements always depend on the respective outsourcing service. For example, the greater the need for protection of the outsourced customer's outsourced IT systems and applications, the more carefully and in detail the contract between outsourcing customers and outsourcing service providers must be negotiated with regard to the security measures to be taken. In addition to the requirements of the IT-Grundschutz Compendium, the outsourcing service provider often has to meet additional security requirements due to increased protection requirements (see, among others, OPS.3.1.A3 Creation of a security concept for the outsourcing service).

The following listed aspects should be regulated from the point of view of the outsourcing service provider when drafting the contract in order to be able to guarantee the provision of services in accordance with clear specifications from the outsourcing customer. For the sake of clarity, the described aspects are assigned to the respective topic areas. Further information and details can be found in various components of the IT-Grundschutz Compendium:

** Infrastructure (see eg building block INF.2 data center) **

* Scope of the shared infrastructure
* Requirements of the outsourcing customer to secure the shared infrastructure
* The property rights of all components of the infrastructure
** Organizational regulations / processes (see, for example, module ORP.1 Organization) **

* Non-Disclosure Agreements must be contractually agreed. This should already be taken into account during the contract design phase itself, as security requirements of the outsourcing customer may allow conclusions to be drawn about existing security systems.
* Definition of communication channels and contact persons
* Definition of processes, work processes and responsibilities
* Integration of the service into the value added process of the outsourcing customer
* Division of labor during service provision / cooperation obligations of the outsourcing customer
* Procedures for solving problems, naming contact persons with the necessary authority in both contracting parties
* Regular voting rounds
* How to adjust performance
* Archiving and deletion of data (especially on termination of the contract)
* Accessibility of the outsourcing service provider to IT resources of the outsourcing customer: who accesses which system? What are the responsibilities and rights?
* Access and access rights for outsourcing service provider staff to the Outsourcing customer's premises and IT systems
* Access and access rights for employees of the outsourcing customer to the premises and IT systems of the outsourcing service provider
* physical repository of data
** Personnel (see, for example, module ORP.2 Personnel) **

* Designing the workplaces of outsourcing service personnel that are deployed to the outsourcing customer (eg compliance with the VDU workplace policy)
* Definition and coordination of representation arrangements with both contracting parties
* Commitment to training
** Emergency preparedness (see eg module DERr.4 Emergency Management) **

Categories to classify errors and incidents by type, severity and urgency
* Required actions when an accident occurs
* Reaction times and escalation levels required by the outsourcing customer
* Prompt information of the outsourcing customer about occurred security incidents
* Obligation of the outsourcing customer to cooperate in the resolution of emergencies
* Type of involvement in emergency exercises and time sequence of emergency exercises of the outsourcing customer
* Requirements of the outsourcing customer on the type and extent of data backup
* Agreement on whether or which systems have to be designed redundantly
Of particular importance may be arrangements for cases of force majeure. It should also be clarified, for example, how to ensure the availability of data and systems in the event of a strike by outsourcing service personnel. Especially when outsourcing service providers and outsourcing customers belong to different industries or are located in different countries, the outsourcing customers can be completely surprised by such occurrences.

** Legal framework, liability **

The possibilities of the outsourcing service provider to involve third parties, subcontractors and subcontractors in the provision of services must be regulated. In general, it is not advisable to exclude them in principle, but to define meaningful framework conditions.

The ownership and copyright of systems, software and interfaces must be specified. In addition, the re-use of the tools, procedures, scripts and other software used by the outsourcing service provider should be regulated in the event of termination of the service relationship.

There are reasonable notice periods to agree. In this context, it should be ensured that sufficient time remains for the outsourcing customer within the notice periods to take over the outsourced processes themselves or to transfer them to another service provider (15 Orderly termination of an outsourcing relationship).

Often, outsourcing customers seek to set penalties or compensation for eventual non-compliance with service quality. From the point of view of the outsourcing service provider, the following aspects must be taken into account or regulated with the outsourcing customer:

* Quantification of damage occurred
* Measurability of image damage
* Proceedings in case of insolvency of the outsourcing service provider
* Procedure for catastrophic damage
** Next relocations **

The possibilities for the integration of third parties, subcontractors and subcontractors by the outsourcing service provider are to be regulated. In general, it is advisable not to exclude this principle, but to establish meaningful conditions. In principle, any further relocation should only be permissible if all the requirements that are met by the service provider under the existing outsourcing relationship are met.

** Client capability **

The requirements for the separation of IT systems and applications of different outsourcing service provider customers must be regulated in a client concept (see OPS.3.1.M10 Planning the maintenance of information security in ongoing outsourcing operations). Based on these regulations, it is possible for the outsourcing service provider to ensure a client-specific separation of requirements in the further course of the project.

If necessary, the physical separation (i.e., dedicated hardware) must be agreed.
If necessary, it must be agreed that the staff employed by the outsourcing service provider will not be used for other outsourcing customers. It may also make sense to oblige them to maintain secrecy, so that the employees employed can not exchange user-related information with other employees of the outsourcing service provider.

** Change Management and Testing **

Rules must be found that allow the outsourcing customer to always adapt to new requirements. This is especially true if, for example, legal requirements have been changed. It is necessary to determine how to react to system extensions, increased requirements or scarce resources.

In this context, the supervision and further development of already existing systems must be regulated. Not infrequently, the outsourcing service provider takes over proprietary systems or software from the outsourcing customer, thus losing the ability to further develop it in his or her sense. The evolutionary path of systems must therefore be regulated.

The time frame required by the outsourcing customer for the correction of errors and malfunctions must be specified.

With regard to test procedures for new hardware and software, the regulations to be observed by the outsourcing service provider must be agreed. In particular, the following aspects should be clarified:

* Regulations for updates and system adjustments
* Separation of test and production systems
* Responsibilities in the creation of test concepts
* Specify test models to use
* Responsibilities of outsourcing customers and outsourcing service providers for the creation of test concepts and the execution of tests (eg cooperation or assistance of the outsourcing customer, acceptance and approval procedures)
* Obligation to inform and agree to important interventions in the system (negative example: the service provider is importing a new version of the operating system on the server.) Unexpected errors disrupt important applications without the customer being able to prepare themselves.)
* Approval procedure for conducting tests
* Determination of reasonable quality losses during the test phase (eg availability)
** checks and exams **

Service quality and information security must be monitored on a regular basis. The service provider must therefore agree with the customer on what information, access, access and access rights are granted. If independent third parties are to carry out audits or benchmark tests, this must also be regulated in the contract.

The service provider must grant all institutions that are required to carry out audits on the customer (eg supervisory authorities) the appropriate control options (eg access rights, data access).

#### OPS.3.1.M3 Creation of a security concept for the outsourcing project [ISB outsourcing service provider]

The outsourcing customer should create his own security concept for the outsourcing project (see building block OPS.2.1 outsourcing for customers). This forms the basis for the security requirements of the outsourcing service provider in the context of the joint outsourcing project. Based on this, the outsourcing service provider was to create a security concept for the respective outsourcing project and continuously update it. The following general aspects should be considered:

* Area of ​​influence and cooperation obligations of the outsourcing customer
* Interfaces and communication between the outsourcing partners, but also between the scope of the outsourcing customer as well as the areas of application of other customers
* Coordinated information network with clear distinction to the security concept of the outsourcing customer
The outsourcing client should classify all sensitive information according to its strategic importance to its institution and communicate that need for protection to the outsourcing service provider. Based on this, a common classification should be developed. The security measures to be implemented are based on this classification.

Contractually stipulated security requirements (see OPS.3.1.M2 contract design with the outsourcing customer) are to be met and also adequately demonstrated to the outsourcing customer upon request. It should also be noted that there may be a need for change during the migration phase. In order to respond, the contracting parties must agree on concrete security measures. For this, the outsourcing service provider should consider resources in the planning.

The implementation of the security concept should be checked regularly.

#### OPS.3.1.M4 Definition of possible communication partners [Head of Organization, Data Protection Officer, ISB Outsourcing Service Provider]

Between outsourcing service providers and outsourcing customers, it should be agreed, documented and contractually agreed in advance which internal and external communication participants may receive which information about the respective outsourcing project. During the outsourcing project, this documentation has to be checked regularly and on an ad hoc basis for its relevance. This should always ensure that the specified contact persons still perform the function originally assigned to them.

If information is to be transmitted to a communication partner outside the institution of the outsourcing service provider, it must be ensured that the recipient has the necessary authorizations to process this information further. In this regard, options and framework conditions must be coordinated in advance with the customer and stipulated by contract.

If information is exchanged between several communicating bodies, it should be clear to all those involved who has or will receive this information as well.

In order to meet the above criteria, it must be determined which communication partners are allowed to receive which information. This requires that all sensitive information be classified according to its strategic importance to the institution.

By means of a communication matrix, all communication partners can either be assigned to the classifications or to the information itself. This allows a clear presentation of the distribution of information.

Furthermore, the communication channels to be used with regard to confidentiality, integrity and availability should also be checked and monitored, since information can also be sent to unauthorized recipients in this way.

Recipients are to be reminded that the data transmitted may only be used for the purpose for which they were transmitted. Also for reasons of data protection (see, for example, BDSG, transfer control) an overview should be created, which recipients are entitled to receive information - in particular personal data - by data transfer or data medium exchange.

#### OPS.3.1.M5 Regulations for the use of the staff of the outsourcing service provider [Head of Personnel, ISB Outsourcing Service Provider]

In the course of an outsourcing service, it may be necessary for employees of the outsourcing service provider to spend a longer period of time in the premises of the outsourcing customer as part of their task fulfillment.
Those employees should be sufficiently briefed and informed about in-house policies and regulations of the outsourced customer on information security and the organization-wide information security policy. If this does not happen on the part of the outsourcing customer, the outsourcing service provider should work towards this. It is of mutual interest that appropriate rules and regulations are known and applied to all parties involved.

Before employing the staff of the outsourcing service provider, any requirements (certificate of good conduct, qualifications, etc.) submitted by the outsourcing customer to the personnel to be deployed should be identified and their fulfillment ensured.

In addition, the outsourcing service provider should ensure that all employees who have access to the outsourced customer's confidential records and data as part of their job performance ensure that they commit in writing to compliance with the relevant applicable laws, regulations and policies of the outsourcing customer , z. For example, a confidentiality declaration (see, among other things, module ORP.5 Requirements Management).

There must be representation arrangements in all areas. In order to achieve continuous availability of important processes, particular care must be taken to ensure that key positions are always filled as soon as this is required by the processes.

For employees who leave the institution or take on other functions, existing regulations must be examined with great care. Successors must be trained, documents must be returned and granted authorizations are revoked. Before the adoption should again be explicitly referred to secrecy obligations.

#### OPS.3.1.M6 Regulations for the Use of External Personnel [Head of Personnel, ISB Outsourcing Service Provider]

In turn, outsourcing service providers often rely on service providers to handle certain subtasks. If external employees could gain access to confidential documents and data of the outsourcing customer, this should be reported to the outsourcing customer. The ISB of the outsourcing customer should then check whether the security requirements that have been set can still be met and whether this results in additional security requirements.

External employees who work for the outsourcing service provider for an extended period of time must make a written commitment to comply with the relevant applicable laws, regulations and internal regulations. In addition, when using external staff, it is important to ensure that they are instructed in their duties when they start working. They are to be informed, as far as necessary to fulfill their duties and obligations, about in-house regulations and information security requirements.

In addition, it should be ensured that substitution regulations also exist for external employees. It should also be ensured that they are familiar with the IT applications they use and that they also have the necessary security measures.

If external personnel (eg maintenance technicians) are to be called in as part of the tasks to be performed, this external personnel should be treated like visitors. For this purpose, the usual regulations for visitor management should be adhered to. It must be understandable what powers the outside personnel have and the deployment should be properly trained and supported according to the need for protection.
At the end of the contract, a regular handover of the work results, received documents and equipment must be carried out. In addition, the outsourcing customer must be provided with physical means of access (eg keys, access cards). Any existing confidentiality obligations remain valid even after the cooperation with the outsourcing customer and must therefore continue to be complied with (see also ORP.2 Personnel).

#### OPS.3.1.M7 Creation of a client concept by the outsourcing service provider [ISB outsourcing service provider]

Frequently, several institutions share central IT infrastructures or services of an outsourcing service provider. Here, applications can be operated and used together, with data storage and data processing z. B. due to legal requirements or due to business and trade secrets must be done separately. In these cases, multi-tenant applications are often referred to, with each serving institution being assigned a client area, or client for short.

In each of these cases, it must be ensured by means of a suitable client concept that the applications are operated as multi-client capable. This includes the fact that every outsourcing customer within his area, ie his client system, can implement the technical specifications (eg with regard to the scope of logging and storage periods) as well as fulfill his control obligations. The client concept is to be created by the outsourcing service provider and made available to the outsourcing customer. He has to convince himself that the client concept provides adequate security for his protection needs before such systems or services are shared with other customers. The client concept is thus part of the security concept that has to be set for an outsourcing project.

From a data protection point of view, too, requirements regarding the separation of clients must be observed. Information on this can be found in the "Multi-client orientation guide" provided by the Working Group on Technology of the Federal Data Protection Commissioners and the Länder.

If an application is newly procured, created or significantly changed, it must first of all be ensured that this application can separate clients cleanly (see S 2.552 Creation of a specification).

A client concept should at least consider the following points:

* Appropriate legal basis: Legal requirements must not preclude a common, multi-client capable process operation. Furthermore, it must be ensured that the technical design of client separation meets the protection requirements of the data in the respective client.
* Completeness of transactions: Data processing performed in one client must not result in the data being changed or readable in other clients.
* Configurational independence of the clients: There should be at least two administrative levels. The first level is used for client administration. Here, client systems are set up and deleted, multi-client configurative settings are made, the roles of the client administrators are assigned, cross-client logging is initiated and their revision is carried out. The second level is used to administer a client system. Here, authorizations are assigned in the client system, client-internal configurations are carried out, client-internal logging is configured, and log revision is carried out.
* Separation of authorization contexts: Each client has its own, completed authorization context. The assignment or modification of authorizations by the administrators of the respective client must not affect authorizations in other clients.
* There must be an administrative level for tenant administration on the part of the operator, but should not have permission to process data within a tenant.
* Separation of logging contexts: Log revisers of a mandate system must not have access to log data of other client systems. For example, clients can have their own log files. Another solution could be that an institution can access the client's log data via filters or report generators set up by the service provider.
* Restricting cross-client data processing: The client administration level should generally not allow processing of data within a client outside of the client administration. The exchange of data between clients should take place via defined and suitably secured interfaces.
The implementation of these requirements can be done in many ways. An outstanding role is played by a suitable role and authorization concept within applications. In addition, at the infrastructure and service level, various methods such as: B. Virtualization techniques are used:

* Use of different databases (also called instances) in a common database management system (DBMS)
* VPD (Virtual Private Database) at the service level for databases
* Store tenant-tagged records in a shared database and shared tables so that client separation occurs through the application.
* Virtual machines at the system level
* Virtual LAN (VLAN), Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF), Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the network infrastructure
The outsourcing customer should check whether the solution chosen by the outsourcing service provider for client separation is effective.

#### OPS.3.1.M8 Agreement for the connection to networks of the outsourcing partners [ISB Outsourcing-Dienstleister]

More and more companies and authorities are merging their hitherto foreclosed networks into network networks, so-called extranets. When connecting the outsourcing service provider's network to the outsourcing customer's network, it is necessary to have a detailed Data Connection Agreement (DCA) in place before connecting to the network.

As a result, the respective access rights of the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer must be precisely defined. Equally important is the question of which users should receive access to the network of the service provider and with what access rights and under what conditions.

The agreement should include the following components:

* A description of what the agreement as a whole includes, including a description of the information networks involved
* A vote on the protection needs and the classification of data (a common understanding must be reached)
* A determination of those responsible (Who is responsible for compliance with the terms of the contract?)
* The naming of contact persons for both organizational and technical problems and in particular for safety-related events
* The information required to classify organizational and technical issues as such as well as security-related events
* Information and specifications for network-internal encryption
* Which services (eg SSH, HTTPS) are provided and which are not
* Which IT platforms, applications and data formats are used
* Whether the network connection results in requirements for the availability of network or IT components at the respective partner (performance, maximum failure rate)
* Who is allowed to log what has to be logged or where the log data are stored and who may access the log data (this may be particularly important in emergency situations)
* To what extent a regular exchange of log data should take place
* What security measures must be taken and how compliance is checked
* A Non-Disclosure Agreement, d. H. an agreement that information obtained by one of the parties involved in the collaboration will not be disclosed to outsiders
* A liability or compensation regulation (this should include the conditions for the separation of the network connection, liability for malicious programs or hacker attacks, penalties for non-performance or liability for use of third-party content to be clarified)
* A regulation on obligations to provide information in the event of security breaches
* A specification of which data may be used for which purposes (eg in the case of further use of work results)
* A description of the extent to which other contractors are involved in the agreement, eg. B. by sharing applications or as a service provider for one of the contractors
* The duration and possibilities of adaptation of the agreement (technology is developing fast, ie the agreements on their use have to be constantly adapted)
The persons responsible for drawing up the agreement should be those who are also responsible for compliance with the regulations. If, due to problems, the connection of the networks has to be temporarily disconnected, however, all affected persons should be included, as their requirements can vary widely but should be taken into account.

A network connection to third-party networks should only be activated if both partners have implemented all security measures that are appropriate for the agreed protection requirements and no identifiable security deficiencies are left. Outsourcing service providers should also be convinced by the security level of their outsourcing customers, for example through an IT-Grundschutz check or spot checks. If the common IT infrastructure is compromised by a vulnerability of the outsourcing customer, the outsourcing service provider will also be confronted with the accusation of negligence in retrospect. In addition, an immediate elimination of all identified safety deficiencies should be sought. In real operation, the availability of an executable product is usually prioritized much higher than the elimination of any security flaws that can then become permanent vulnerabilities.

The outsourcing customer and potential third parties should only be provided with the services that have been contractually agreed upon and are absolutely necessary. Which areas of the own network are granted access to third parties, must be made dependent on the nature of the existing relationships between the contracting parties and mutual trust between them. Foreign partners must be aware of their national laws, eg. In the fields of cryptography, privacy and copyright.

In the event of security incidents that require disconnection, it is important to clearly define who is allowed to do so and when. It must also be clarified which persons should be informed about this process and which escalation steps are planned.

#### OPS.3.1.M9 Agreement on data exchange between the outsourcing partners [ISB Outsourcing Service Provider]

For regular data exchange between the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer, agreements should be made to ensure its smooth and secure operation.

Such agreements should include in particular the following components:

* Appointment of contact persons for both organizational and technical challenges, and in particular for security-related events
* Definition of the necessary technical and organizational framework conditions, for example about

 
+ which applications and data formats are supported and
+ what availability and speed of reaction the partners have to guarantee (how often are messages read and how fast are they to answer)


 
* Defining the security measures that must be ensured during data exchange, eg. B.

 
+ Check the data for malware before and after the exchange,
+ Protection of data against damage during transport and unauthorized access during transmission (sealed containers, checksums, encryption, signatures),
+ Control of key management,
+ Deletion of the data on the transmitter side at the earliest after the confirmation of the correct reception (if the deletion is necessary)


 
* A Non-Disclosure Agreement, d. H. an agreement that information obtained by one of the parties involved in the collaboration will not be disclosed to outsiders
* Determining which data may be used for which purposes (eg when using further work results)
* Obligation to comply with relevant laws, regulations and regulations, such as privacy and copyright laws or licensing regulations
Further points that should be included in such an agreement can be found in block OPS.1.2.3 Data medium exchange and building block APP.1 E-Mail / Groupware / Communication.

#### OPS.3.1.M10 Planning and maintenance of information security in ongoing outsourcing operations [ISB Outsourcing Service Provider]

Once an outsourcing project has been implemented, information security must be guaranteed during ongoing operations. To ensure this, outsourcing customers and outsourcing service providers must cooperate appropriately. Thus, the outsourcing customer has to create an operating concept in which all relevant safety aspects are taken into account. Outsourcing service providers should assist outsourcing customers in particular with regard to the following aspects:

* Regular updating of documentation and policies.
* Examination of the applicable security concepts (are these still coordinated and is the desired level of security still guaranteed?). In particular, the outsourcing service provider should inform outsourcing customers about important changes in their sphere of influence.
* Creation of a client concept by the outsourcing service provider, which describes how client separation is ensured in the course of operating IT systems and applications. The outsourcing service provider has to ensure that disruptions to other customers do not affect the processes and systems of the outsourcing customer. In addition, it must be ensured that data from the outsourcing customer are under no circumstances accessible to other outsourcing service provider's customers.
* Implementation of the agreed audits on the implementation status of the agreed security measures.
* To provide necessary information and / or contact information to subcontractors of the outsourcing service provider, in order to facilitate audits.
* Documentation of the (maintenance) status of systems and applications (performance, availability, quality level, capacity).
* Collaboration on data protection (see OPS.1.1.5 Backup).
* Furthermore, the outsourcing service provider should take part in regular voting rounds on the following points:

 
+ Exchange of information (eg personnel news, organizational regulations, changes to the law, planned projects, planned tests and system changes that can lead to impairment of service quality)
+ Information about security risks and dealing with them
+ Problem identification and analysis
+ Mutual feedback and the identification of potential for improvement (to motivate employees, particularly positive examples of successful cooperation can be presented)
+ Change management: Change requests (hardware, software, expansion of the service portfolio, increased resource requirements, etc.) of the outsourcing customer should be discussed early to ensure their timely implementation.


 
* Planning, implementation and evaluation of exercises and tests on the following topics:

 
+ Reaction to system failures (partial failure, total failure)
+ Restoring backups
+ Control of security incidents


 
#### OPS.3.1.M11 Access, Access and Access Control [Head of Organization, ISB Outsourcing Service Provider]

An outsourcing service provider typically services several outsourcing clients at the same time, sending in their own staff, as well as auditors and other auditors. It must be ensured that customers do not get access to IT systems, networks or data of other customers.

In order to adequately protect the outsourcing service provider's business processes, information and IT systems as well as the various outsourcing customers, access, access and access rights must be regulated and an appropriate organizational framework created (see also ORP.4 Identity and Access Rights) authorization management).

Appropriate and workable authorizations must be granted at various levels (eg for access to premises, access to IT systems, access to applications). Only as many rights should be assigned as are necessary for the task perception. There must be a regulated procedure for the allocation, management and withdrawal of entitlements.

If people newly transfer or submit tasks, authorizations must be created, changed or deleted promptly and their user IDs activated or deactivated. Room access, access to information, and access to IT systems should be secured so that people can access only the information they need. Basically, the access to all IT systems and services should be secured by identification and authentication of the accessing users or IT systems.

There should be guidelines for the type and design of the respective authentication, eg. For example, to the type of authentication over ownership, knowledge or biometric properties and minimum requirements for passwords. Default standard passwords must be changed immediately after installation, at the latest when the hardware or software is put into operation for the first time. Employees must be trained for the correct use of authentication mechanisms.

The allocation of authorizations should be based on the functions of the authorized persons. Roles and thus permissions should be separated appropriately. The assignment, modification and withdrawal of authorizations and authentication means must be documented.

#### OPS.3.1.M12 Change Management [IT Operations, Change Manager]

With the complexity of today's IT systems, even minor changes to running systems can lead to security issues, such as: Due to unexpected system behavior or system failures. In terms of information security, change management is responsible for identifying new security requirements that result from changes to IT systems. In case of breakdowns or underpayments by the outsourcing service provider, sensitive contractual penalties may be due. In addition, the outsourcing customer's value creation process and thus the relationship between the outsourcing partners suffer, which could result in a sustained loss of reputation for the outsourcing service provider.
If significant hardware or software changes to an IT system are planned, the implications for overall system security must be investigated. Changes to an IT system must not lead to a reduction in the efficiency of individual security measures.

Therefore, there should be guidelines for making changes to IT components, software or configuration data (see module OPS.1.2.1 Change Management). Any changes to IT components, software, or configuration data should follow a standardized process. This process must ensure that changes

* planned,
* prioritized,
* rated,
* implemented,
* tested / tested,
* Approved,
* documented,
and be reviewed after their implementation. It must be ensured that all security-relevant changes are appropriately addressed. These include, for example:

* Changes to IT systems (new hardware, extension or modification of the network, new applications and modifications to the software used, import of security patches, etc.),
* Spatial changes, eg. For example after a move,
* Changes in the task or in the importance of the task for the institution,
* Changes in user structure (new, external or anonymous, user groups),
* User behavior change (demand at specific times or dates, quantities or capacities requested, etc.)
Before changes are approved and implemented, checks and tests of planned actions must ensure that the level of security is maintained during and after the change. If risks, in particular for availability, can not be ruled out, the planning must also provide for a fallback solution and specify criteria as to when this should take effect. All changes and the corresponding decision-making principles must be documented. This applies both in the operating and in a test environment. In change management, the authorization concept for making changes is an important issue:

* Only those who are allowed to make changes should have access privileges to the relevant system areas.
* There should be mechanisms to ensure that all significant changes have been agreed in advance.
Note: When making changes, it should always be kept in mind that changes in an IT system or its operating conditions may require changes in the implementation of individual security measures, the creation of a new security concept or even the revision of the organization-wide information security guideline. For major changes, therefore, the information security management of the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer should be involved.

#### OPS.3.1.M13 Secure migration for outsourcing projects

The migration phase starts after the contract has been concluded. As part of the migration, the following contractual provisions will be implemented:

* Agreements regarding services and solutions in accordance with the contractual provisions and the general terms and conditions,
* Service agreements, requirements specifications, service catalog and descriptions, service level,
* detailed outsourcing model and updated business case,
* Migration plan.
After being commissioned by the outsourcing customer, a security management team should be set up specifically for the migration phase on the part of the outsourcing customer. This should be supplemented by qualified employees of the outsourcing service provider. The size of the (joint) security management team should be dependent on the type and size of the outsourcing project, as a minimum it can consist of one security expert each of the customer and the service provider. As the primary contact for information security, the information security officer must be designated by the customer and the service provider.

In order to promote the success of the migration phase, the outsourcing customer - in particular its security management team - should be actively involved in the project during the entire migration phase by the outsourcing service provider. In particular, it should be ensured that it is informed in good time about current progress, developments and possible complications.

For this purpose a committee with qualified contact persons of both sides for the migration management should be established and the frequency of working meetings should be determined. The respective responsibilities are to be defined in advance and fixed in writing, as well as possible posts that support the committee.

"Qualified contacts" in this context means those who have the necessary expertise and skills required for the outsourcing service and are trained in the specific tasks and challenges of an outsourcing project (organization, communication, conflict management ).

All members of the committee should be experienced in communicating with employees and other outsourcing partners. The sometimes considerable organizational changes that all outsourcing customers have to get used to can lead to resistance that not only adversely affects immediate collaboration but also influences the success of the outsourcing project. In order not to endanger the outsourcing project and to prevent and / or reduce resistance, a sensitive communication of all measures is necessary.

The outsourcing customer has the justified interest in monitoring their implementation during the migration phase. To this end, the necessary structures and resources should be created and provided, such as: For example, defined communication channels and procedures, as well as escalation templates and regular reporting. Thus, the migration can be carried out transparently, which makes the achievement of goals by both sides measurable and leads to a sustainable, trusting outsourcing relationship.

In addition, a training course for the staff of the outsourcing customer should be planned during this phase. These will work on newly created interfaces in the future. The outsourcing service provider should support this. The implementation of training and its sustainability are in the interest of the outsourcing service provider, as this can not provide its service to the agreed extent or with the required quality level due to insufficient additional work. This in turn can negatively affect the outsourcing relationship and thus the reputation of the outsourcing service provider.

In the course of the migration, the test operation is of great importance. Especially for test purposes and in phases of heavy workload, "flexible" and "uncomplicated" solutions are often chosen, which are often uncertain. This should be avoided. For example, it should be ensured that productive data are not used as test data without special protection. This must be excluded by the security concept accordingly.
The following aspects should be considered by the outsourcing service provider during the migration phase:

* For the migration phase, a security concept must be created.
* The outsourcing service provider has to define clear responsibilities and hierarchies for the migration phase. Clear leadership structures are a prerequisite. In addition, contact persons and responsibilities should also be defined at high levels. This is the only way to ensure that, if in doubt, action can be taken with appropriate emphasis.
* The required tests have to be planned and carried out, approval procedures have to be prepared and the production introduction has to be planned.
* The outsourcing service provider must select appropriate internal staff for the test, induction and later operations. It should be examined to what extent the outsourcing customer should be contractually given a say in the selection of personnel.
* The outsourcing service provider must get to know exactly the relevant processes, applications and IT systems of the outsourcing customer and, if necessary, actively request a briefing.
* Trouble-free operation must be ensured by accurate resource planning and tests in advance. The productive systems must not be neglected. In addition, interference must be taken into account by necessary tests.
* Applications and IT systems that the outsourcing service provider should take over must be sufficiently documented. The documentation of new systems or subsystems must also be ensured.
* During the migration, it is necessary to constantly check whether the SLAs or the security measures provided need to be adapted.
In the introductory phase of the outsourcing project and the first period of operation, special attention must be given to the emergency approach. Until the necessary routine, for example in the handling of malfunctions and security-related incidents, has set in with all participants, more and more employees should be obliged to stand-by services.

After the migration has been completed, it must be ensured that the security concept is updated, as experience has shown that there are always changes during the migration phase. This means in particular:

* All security measures must be specified.
* Internal and external contact persons and responsibilities should be documented with names and necessary contact details (telephone, times of availability, possibly required assignment terms such as customer numbers).
* The system configurations must be documented, whereby the set safety-relevant parameters must also be recorded.
* The staff must be prepared for regular operations by means of training.
* All derogations must be lifted at the end of the migration phase.
As a final task, after the migration phase, the outsourcing service must be transferred to secure regular operation (see OPS.3.1.M10 Planning and Maintaining Information Security in Outsourced Outsourcing Operations).

#### OPS.3.1.M14 Emergency Preparedness for Outsourcing [Emergency Representative]

For outsourced tasks and processes of the outsourcing customer, the same requirements apply to emergency preparedness as in the case of self-provision. This means that the outsourcing service provider must adapt its emergency preparedness measures to the requirements of the outsourcing customer as part of the corresponding outsourcing, especially with regard to recovery and recovery times.

Effective joint emergency preparedness strongly enhances trust in the outsourcing relationship and can improve the outsourcing service provider's own emergency preparedness. Synergies may arise as the outsourcing customer may provide emergency workplaces for outsourced service staff in-house.
Basically, the emergency plans of both parties should be coordinated. Since this condition is not static, this vote should be repeated regularly and on an ad hoc basis. Interfaces (eg network connection, routers, telecommunication providers) between the contracting parties and third parties must be identified and taken into account in the context of emergency preparedness. In OPS.3.1.M2 contract design with the outsourcing customer is described which aspects should already be regulated in the service level agreement.

In the emergency preparedness concept, the following aspects must be precisely specified and described in detail:

* Responsibilities, contacts and processes must be clearly regulated and fully documented.
* Detailed regulations for the data backup (see module OPS.1.1.5 Data backup) are to be created (eg separate backup media for each client, availability, substitution regulations, escalation strategies, virus protection).
* Make detailed work instructions with specific arrangements for specific error situations.
* A concept for periodic emergency exercises needs to be developed and agreed with the outsourcing client.
When an emergency occurs in the outsourcer's home, the quality of emergency work instructions is critical to the effectiveness of the emergency response. For this reason, the outsourcing customer should be interested in coordinating the emergency measures to be taken with the outsourcing service provider. However, it is also in the interest of the outsourcing service provider to ensure a competent and rapid response to outsourcing customer emergencies, as the customer's continued existence and reputation may be compromised.

The outsourcing service provider must be aware that the outsourcing customer may lose essential know-how for the outsourced area as a result of outsourcing and that an adequate emergency response is often only possible with the support of the outsourcing service provider.

It is also possible that IT systems of the outsourcing customer are operated by employees of the outsourcing service provider, without them having detailed knowledge of the applications that are operated on the IT systems. If an error occurs in an application, the outsourcing service provider may need to troubleshoot without having extensive knowledge of the overall system. The outsourcing service provider should therefore ensure that the emergency preparedness plan contains detailed instructions on how to proceed in the context of emergency management. It may also make sense to define actions that are explicitly forbidden (eg reboot a machine).

Misbehavior of an application may be technical (eg full disk, network problems) or application specific causes (eg processing of a wrong record, program error, wrong parameter setting). In the event of technical errors without any impact on other applications, the outsourcing service provider will be able to correct the error itself, but cooperation with the outsourcing customer is usually necessary to prevent undesirable side effects at the application level. Especially with problems with complicated applications or with extensive batch processes, often knowledge is required which only one of the contracting parties has. Therefore, cooperative approaches, communication and escalation plans must be planned in advance.
In addition, the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer should conduct joint exercises on a regular basis to verify or prove the effectiveness of the emergency preparedness of the tasks and processes transferred. The outsourcing service provider should consider the resources needed to plan, conduct and follow up the exercises in its calculations.

#### OPS.3.1.M15 Orderly termination of an outsourcing ratio [Institutional Management]

As a rule, the recommendations of this measure can only be implemented if all relevant topics were already settled in the contract with the outsourcing customer at the end of the contract (see OPS.3.1.M2 Contract design with the outsourcing customer). For example, proper back-integration of the outsourced processes or their transfer to another outsourcing service provider is only possible if sufficient time remains within the specified notice periods.

In addition, sufficient precautions must be taken to ensure that the outsourcing contract does not affect the outsourcing client's business.

The following aspects should be considered:

* Property rights to hardware and software (interface programs, tools, batch processes, macros, licenses, backups) must be regulated.
* The re-use of the tools, procedures, scripts and other software used by the outsourcing service provider is to be regulated in the event of the termination of the contractual relationship.
* IT systems, IT applications and workflows should be sufficiently documented to help outsourcing customers reintegrate outsourced processes and activities.
* All necessary information and data must be transferred from the outsourcing service provider to the outsourcing customer.
* All data stocks of the outsourcing customer at the outsourcing service provider must be securely deleted.
* All permissions that have been set up as part of the outsourcing project should be reviewed. The outsourcing service provider should delete all authorizations set up for the outsourcing customer or third parties.
### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### OPS.3.1.M16 Security check of employees [Head of Personnel] (CI)

The possibilities of having the trustworthiness of new or foreign personnel checked are legally very limited in Germany, but also in many other countries. In addition, the results are usually not very meaningful, such. B. in police certificates.

In addition, it may be useful to have academic and professional qualifications certified, for example by inquiring at the university or from previous employers or clients. The identity of the candidate should also be verified. B. by presentation of identity documents.

The outsourcing service provider should therefore coordinate with the outsourcing customers in advance of the service provision with regard to the requirements of the personnel to be deployed. These requirements should be taken into account with every change of personnel or new employees.

When drafting the contract between the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer, it should be noted which side has to carry out which checks, if necessary, and to what extent these have to be carried out.
