### 1.1 Introduction

For the exchange of information, trust relationships between the communication partners must first be established and clarified, how the exchanged information must be protected and how it should be transported.

Even with a broadband network connection, it may be useful or necessary to transmit data carriers for the exchange of information for various reasons. Data carriers can be exchanged during personal meetings or via shipping. Typically used media are removable disks, CD-ROMs, DVDs, USB sticks and hard disks. It should not be forgotten that even paper documents are data carriers for which the same security requirements must be observed, depending on the protection requirements of the respective information.

In addition, this module also takes into account the storage of the data on the sender and receiver system, insofar as it is directly related to the data medium exchange, as well as the handling of the data carriers before or after the transfer.

Described is the process of information and data carrier exchange, z. For example, at personal meetings, via IT networks or via shipping.

### 1.2 Life cycle

** planning and conception **

In the run-up to the exchange of information and data media, it must be clarified and bindingly stipulated under which framework conditions and with which communication partners an exchange may take place (see OPS.1.2.3.M2 regulation of the information exchange and OPS.1.2.3.M7 regulation of the data medium exchange).

**Procurement**

The selection of suitable data media must be agreed with the communication partners.

**Implementation**

In order to prevent security problems in the exchange of information, appropriate security measures should be established, which are appropriate for the respective protection needs, types of data and transport routes. In order to minimize any possible damage caused by improper handling of the data carriers during transport, a suitable method of dispatch should be specified which, depending on the data carrier used (eg documents, CD-ROM, magnetic tape), may well be different.

**Business**

When carrying out the information and data medium exchange, a number of measures must be taken to avoid possible damage or to minimize its effects. These include access and tamper protection, z. For example, by encryption as well as in data carriers safe storage and packaging and a clear identification in order to reduce the risk of confusion. For general hygiene, digital information includes a check for computer viruses prior to sending or handover, and also after receipt.

** ** segregation

If data carriers are being exchanged with different communication partners, these data carriers should be physically deleted before they are used again, in order to avoid transmitting information to the wrong recipient.

** Emergency Preparedness **

Since it can never be ruled out that information will not reach its recipient, for example because data carriers are lost during transport, the transmitted data should at least be stored locally in a copy until the correct receipt has been confirmed. Depending on the nature and purpose of the information and data medium exchange, a longer storage may be required as evidence for later conflicts.

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the section "Information and media exchange".

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### OPS.1.2.3.M1 Definition of permitted communication partners [Head of Organization]If information is to be transmitted to a communication partner outside of their own institution, it must be ensured that the recipient has the necessary authorizations to receive and process this information. Similarly, the identity of the communication partner must be verified before confidential information is disclosed. If information is exchanged between several communicating bodies, it should be clear to all those involved who has also received or will receive this information. In order to meet the above criteria, it must be determined which communication partners are allowed to receive which information. This requires that all information be classified according to its strategic importance to the institution.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M2 Regulation of Information Exchange [Head of Organization]

Information can come in different forms. In most cases, in the field of IT-Grundschutz, paper-based information or electronically recorded information is considered. In general, all information needs to be adequately protected, from thoughts and ideas, through written and printed presentations, to electronic messages, voice, video or video recordings.

If information is to be exchanged between two or more communication partners, a number of different aspects must be observed in order to protect it. For any type of information exchange, it must first be clarified

* how vulnerable these are,
* with whom these may be exchanged (see OPS.1.2.3.M1 definition of permitted communication partners) and
* how these are to be protected, eg. By being encrypted.
For this purpose, clear and comprehensible rules must be in place that cover all forms of information exchange, such as verbal exchange as well as data exchange via data carrier, mail, fax, (mobile) telephone or Internet. In general, it must be ensured that information can not get into the wrong hands, eyes and ears and that they can not be changed unnoticed.

All employees must be aware that they are responsible for adequately protecting internal information. For example, sketches of ideas on paper should not be left in meeting rooms, project plans should not be discussed in public transport or in the restaurant, callers should not be informed of unannounced internals. Protective information should not be printed or left unattended on printers or fax machines. Blackboards and whiteboards in meeting, training and event rooms must be cleaned at the end of each session, and any flipchart sheets used must be removed. Employees should be regularly alerted to such aspects, such as appropriate explanations and illustrations on the intranet or in the house newspaper.

Recipients must be advised that the data transmitted may only be used for the purpose for which they were disclosed. Also for reasons of data protection (see, for example, BDSG, transfer control) an overview should be created, which recipients are entitled to receive information, in particular personal data, by data transfer or data medium exchange.

**Example:**

An institution concludes a contract with a cloud service provider to use a defined cloud service. The selected cloud service provider, for its part, uses services of a subcontractor and forwards the data of the institution to the latter for processing. All communication channels as well as the type and scope of the transferred data are in this case transparent by the cloud service provider.Communication partners should regularly check whether they are entitled to receive the relevant information. Thus, among other things, the company affiliation, the postal or e-mail address or the fax number may have changed and transmitted information so reach the wrong person. In the case of a first contact, the identity of the other person should also be checked, since business cards can be issued on any name. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with new business partners in their authority or company or to obtain references.

The way in which analogue and electronic information is to be protected during the exchange of information is described in detail in the module APP.1.1 E-Mail / Groupware.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M3 Instructing staff to exchange information [Specialists]

Employees must be sufficiently informed as to which framework conditions and restrictions must be adhered to when passing on information (see OPS.1.2.3.M2 Regulation of Information Exchange). Inadequate instruction in this can lead to a variety of security issues. This includes, for example, informing employees

* with which communication partners which information may be exchanged (see OPS.1.2.3.M1 definition of permitted communication partners),
* that the identity of the communication partners should be checked before confidential information is disclosed,
* in which premises information can be communicated and processed,
* via which IT networks information may be transported and how these are to be secured,
* What types of media are allowed for media exchange and how to secure them.
In addition, the basic steps for the course of an information and data medium exchange to fix and publish, for. On the intranet. Employees are required to comply with the regulations.

In addition, the employees involved in the exchange of information and data carriers must be made aware of the specific hazards before, during and after transport. Accordingly, these employees must be made fully acquainted with the security measures to be followed.

Before reading any digital media that was in the mailbox, even though it was not expected, you should ask the specified senders if they have actually sent the media (see also OPS1.1.4 Malware Protection). The same applies to e-mail or other communication. For unknown consignors or unexpected deliveries, the safety management should be informed if no other regulations have been adopted by the management level for this case.

If certain IT-based procedures are used to protect the data during the exchange (such as encryption or checksum procedures), the appropriate staff must be adequately trained in the handling of these procedures.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M4 Malware Protection [User]

Immediately before and immediately after a data transfer and when exchanging or shipping data carriers, these must be checked for malware (see OPS1.1.4 Protection against malicious programs). It is important to ensure that the protection program used can detect macro viruses and that it is up-to-date.The sender should attach a malware audit log to the submitted volume or attach it to a file sent electronically. It is recommended to keep this log as a copy. The recipient would have a first impression of the integrity of the transmitted data on the basis of this protocol. However, this does not release the recipient from another malware check. On the other hand, the sender can make it plausible in case of complaints about malicious software that infestation was unlikely.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M5 loss report [user]

Loss or theft of a data carrier during data medium exchange or the suspicion of manipulation must be reported immediately. This also applies to private data media that are used for official purposes. For this, there must be clear reporting channels and contact persons in each institution. When a disk is lost, action must be taken quickly, as it is not just a question of transmitting the data, but also of preventing potential misuse of the information involved.

If there is confidential information on the media, it must be promptly traded after it is lost, for example:

* Information classified as confidential (eg, patient records): All affected areas (eg, department, customers, etc.) must be notified to take appropriate action.
Also, defects in low-priced mobile disks should be reported so that IT management can see if larger shipments are affected. Particularly for data carriers used for data backup and archiving, high reliability and a long service life are important.

If lost media reappear, they must be inspected for possible tampering. If there is a suspicion, the device must either be disposed of immediately or further examined by a specialist. To make sure there are no malicious programs or malware on the recovered disks, they should be physically deleted (see OPS.1.2.3.M8 Physical Disk Erase Before and After Use).

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures correspond to the state of the art in the field of "information and data medium exchange".

#### OPS.1.2.3.M6 Agreements to exchange information with external [Head of Organization]

In a regular exchange of information with external partners, the framework conditions should be agreed. It should be clarified how the mutual understanding of the protection needs of the information is. If necessary, a common classification scheme should be used. In addition, it should be noted:

* whether and how to protect what types of information
* via which transmission channels the information exchange may take place at all,
* that confidentiality agreements are signed by the employees involved (see also OPS.1.2.3.M10 Conclusion of Confidentiality Agreements),
* that information may only be disclosed to third parties if the creator or information owner agrees
* * how the security level established in the partner's information network is demonstrated, for example by means of an audit,
* how security incidents should be reported to the partners,
* how disputes about information handling are escalated,
* how to get early warnings about potential security issues
* which legal conditions are to be observed.

In the event of security incidents or emergencies, the normal form of communication between the partners may be disrupted. It should be clarified whether in such cases the exchange of information should continue. If so, appropriate emergency plans should be developed together.#### OPS.1.2.3.M7 Control of data medium exchange [Head of Organization]

The proper data medium exchange should be regulated on the basis of the requirements for the exchange of information (see OPS.1.2.3.M2 regulation of the information exchange). In doing so, prior authorization should be given for authorized recipients and appropriate types of shipping for the different types of media and information to be exchanged. In addition, it should be specified how the data carriers are to be protected in their own institution, during transport and at the recipient.

If data carriers are to be exchanged between two or more communication partners, a number of recommendations must be observed for proper exchange.

Depending on the type of data carriers and the protection requirements of the data, a suitable method of dispatch must be specified. In particular, the type of data carriers and the protection requirements of the information must be taken into account.

In addition to the implementation notes outlined in OPS.1.2.3.M14 Disk Management, the shipping method of the data carriers should be based on the risk potential. In terms of availability, the shipping method should be selected in such a way that a timely delivery can be guaranteed. The more people are involved in the promotion and the longer the times when the media remains unattended, the less the confidentiality and integrity can generally be guaranteed. Accordingly, appropriate shipping methods should be selected.

You can z. For example, choose between the following shipping methods:

* Post (with various shipping offers that include different guarantees for transport speed and protection),
* Courier services,
* personal courier and
* personal handover.
It is advisable for a public authority or a company to keep a list of appropriate shipping methods proposed for different media and their protection needs. This not only makes it easier for employees to choose from the best possible price-performance ratio, but also for optimum safety. This list should cover at least the following aspects:

* average transport time of the shipping method or the courier
* Reliability of the shipping method or the courier
* Costs.
Addressing must be unambiguous to avoid incorrect delivery. In addition to the name of the recipient, the organizational unit and the exact name of the authority or company should be indicated. Within an institution, directories of the most common addresses should be maintained so that the most up-to-date and correct addresses of the recipients are used.

The address of the sender must also be clearly and completely specified. For this purpose, a specification should be created within the institution, which regulates the scope and structure of the sender information uniformly.

Digital media should (optionally) be accompanied by a data carrier accompanying note containing the following information:

* Sender,
* Receiver,
* Type and amount of data carriers,
* Serial number (if available),
* Identifier for the contents of the disk,
* Date of shipment, if applicable date until when the data medium must have reached the recipient at the latest,
* Note that volumes are scanned for viruses,
* Parameters needed to read the information, eg. B. belt speed.
However, it should not be noted

* which password was given for the possibly protected information,
* which keys were used to encrypt the information
* what content the disk has.
The correct reception should be checked. For consignments with highly confidential or on-time content, the recipients should be informed of the despatch and the chosen route of transport. If the need for protection is high, it is advisable to ask the recipient for a confirmation of receipt.In each case responsible for the dispatch and for the receipt must be named. If there are indications of manipulation or loss, safety management must be informed immediately.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M8 Physical deletion of media before and after use [user]

In addition to the instructions for deleting or destroying data carriers contained in OPS.1.1.8 Deletion and destruction, the following points should be noted for data medium exchange:

Disks intended for replacement should be physically erased before writing to the information to be transmitted. This is to ensure that no residual data is passed on, for the receipt of which the recipient has no authorization.

A physical deletion sufficient for the normal protection requirement can be achieved by overwriting the entire data medium or at least the areas used with a specific pattern. For magnetic data carriers, a single overwriting is sufficient. For data carriers that are based on flash memory, such as USB sticks, it can not be ensured for technical reasons that a complete overwriting actually deletes all stored data. However, this is also sufficient for normal protection needs. In case of increased protection requirements, the use of flash memory should be avoided, or the memory should be completely encrypted. It is also possible to format the data carrier if it can not be undone, ie no quick formatting. It should be avoided to delete only individual files, this often remains residual information obtained, which allow the reconstruction of the deleted files. Employees should be provided with appropriate physical delete programs before and after using data media.

As a rule, the transmitted data are also worth protecting for the recipient. Analogously, a physical deletion of the data carrier is also provided here after the data is re-imported.

The use of non-erasable data carriers (such as WORMs) is to be waived for the purpose of exchanging data if there are other non-recipient information that can not be deleted.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M9 Eliminate Remaining Information in Files before Submitting [User]

Before sending a file via e-mail, IT networks or media exchange, or before publishing a file to a web server, it should be checked to see if it contains any residual information that is not intended for publication. Such residual information can be of different origin and, accordingly, the actions to be taken against it can be different. The most common causes of such residual information are described below.

Generally, standard software such as For example, for word processing or spreadsheets, which additional information is stored in files created with it. Some of this information is saved with, others without the knowledge of the user.

Before passing on files, they should at least be randomly checked for unwanted additional information. This should be done using a different editor than the one used to create the file.

Care must be taken to ensure that not all remaining information can be deleted without destroying the file format. If z. For example, if some bytes are deleted from a word processing file, the word processor may no longer recognize the file format. To eliminate residual information,

* the file can be saved in another file format, eg. As "plain text", as a printout in PDF or as HTML,* The user data can be copied to a second instance of the same standard software, whereas no other application should run on the IT system. This is especially useful for files with a larger history of changes.
In order to prevent the disclosure of information that was originally introduced with the knowledge of the creators, such. For example, if it is formatted as "hidden" text but its presence has been forgotten, it may be useful to print the file. In this case, all options should be activated that also output hidden information during printing.

** Remaining information in the file system **

If a file is deleted in the normal way, the operating system marks it as deleted in the file system only, without removing the actual contents. When distributing data carriers, this must be taken into account accordingly, since otherwise z. For example, deleted intermediate versions or temporary files could be recovered by the recipient. In addition, many applications have the problem that the respective program when editing a file does not consistently overwrite the used memory space with application data, so that gaps can arise that may also contain old data.

So sensitive information files should not be edited directly on a redistributable. Instead, the final version of the file should be copied to a volume that has been erased before and after use before it is discarded, according to OPS.1.2.3.M8 Physical Disk Erase.

In addition, special features of the file system used must be taken into account. The Windows file system NTFS, for example, stores the contents of very small files (up to about 700 bytes) directly in the NTFS management structure, the so-called Master File Table (MFT). Files of this size are often configuration settings or meta-information. If these files grow later, the original content in the MFT may be preserved. In addition, NTFS may store information in Alternate Data Streams (ADS) that are not directly visible. In the case of sensitive information, disclosure is normally undesirable. ADS can be viewed and removed with special tools, or the file can be copied to a file system that does not support ADS (such as FAT32 or exFAT).

** Hidden text / comments **

A file can contain text passages formatted as "hidden" or "hidden". Some programs also offer the ability to add comments that are hidden on the printout and often on the screen. Such passages may contain remarks that are not intended for the recipient. Therefore, additional information must be deleted in files before being passed on to external users.

** revision marks **

When editing files, it may be useful to use change markers. Since these can be hidden on the printout and on the screen, it is also necessary to check whether they contain change labels before passing on files.

** versioning **

In virtually all current Office suites, it is possible to save different versions of a document in a ** file. This serves to be able to resort to earlier revision statuses if necessary. But this can very quickly lead to huge files, eg. B. if graphics are included. Under no circumstances should the option "Save version automatically when closing" be selected, as the complete previous version is additionally saved here each time a file is closed.

** File properties **As file properties or file info, information is stored in the file to help later find files. Depending on the application, information such as titles, directory structures, version levels, editors (not just the undersigned), comments, processing time, last print date, document names and descriptions may be included. Some of this information is created by the programs themselves and can not be influenced by the editor. Other information must be entered manually. Before passing on a file to external users, check which additional information of this type contains the file.

** Quick save **

Some applications, such as older word processors, use the fast save option to save only the changes since the last backup and not the entire document. This process may take less time than a full save. However, the key disadvantage is that the file may contain fragments of the previous version, which should have been removed by the revision. Basically, therefore, quick save options should be turned off.

If the user still chooses the fast storage option, he should always perform a full save on the following situations:

* when editing a document is complete,
* before running another application that takes up a lot of memory,
* before the document text is transferred to another application,
* before the document is converted to another file format and
* before the document is sent by e-mail or data medium exchange.
Users should be informed about the dangers of residual and additional information in files and be shown the problem by way of example. Random checks of the files for contained information should be performed. Users should be taught how to avoid residual and additional information in files.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M10 Conclusion of Confidentiality Agreements [Head of Organization]

If confidential information is shared with external parties when exchanging information, it should be required to treat it as confidential. First of all, a common understanding of the need for protection of the information has to be established. In addition, non-disclosure agreements should be concluded.

A confidentiality agreement should describe

* which information must be kept confidential,
* for which period this confidentiality agreement applies,
* what actions must be taken upon termination of this agreement, eg. B. destruction or return of data carriers,
* how the ownership of information is regulated,
* what regulations apply to the use and disclosure of confidential information to other partners, if necessary
* what consequences occur in case of breach of the agreement.
Confidentiality agreements may be concluded with individuals or with other institutions. If a confidentiality agreement is concluded with an institution, it must inform all affected employees about it and commit them to compliance.

The confidentiality agreement may also refer to the relevant security policies and other policies of the institution. A confidentiality agreement provides the legal basis for obliging external parties to treat information in a confidential manner. For this reason, it must take into account all relevant laws and regulations for the institution in the specific area of ​​application, be clearly worded and kept up to date.It may be useful to use different confidentiality agreements depending on the purpose. In this case, it must be clearly defined which agreement is necessary for which cases.

An example of a confidentiality agreement is the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP). This is used, for example, for communication in the Alliance for Cyber ​​Security or between CERTs. This obligation is designed to create confidence in the protection of information exchanged by regulating the transfer using the TLP. The TLP can also be used as an example for the creation of own confidentiality agreements, see also the leaflet for the treatment of confidential information under [ACS1].

#### OPS.1.2.3.M11 Compatibility check of the sender and receiver system [IT operation]

Before exchanging information, the systems and products used on the sender and receiver side should be checked for compatibility.

With data medium exchange, information can be transmitted more or less reliably depending on the degree of compatibility of the receiver and transmitter systems. Depending on the complexity of the data to be exchanged, different compatibility requirements must be met. Therefore, before setting up a regular exchange of information or data media, the conformity of the following characteristics should be checked in order to identify incompatibilities in advance and remedy where necessary:

* Physical medium:
 When exchanging the media, it is of course necessary that the ** physical media ** of the receiver and transmitter system coincide. However, mechanical equivalence is not enough, because the mismatch of parameters such as speed in bands can lead to problems.
* Character code (eg ASCII or EBCDIC):
 If the sender and receiver systems match the ** character code ** used, individual sectors or blocks in plain text that can be distributed unrelated on the data carrier can be read using physical reading. If the character codes used do not match, the transmitted data will be misinterpreted.
* Formatting the operating system or file system of media:
 In addition, if the sender and receiver systems have the same operating and file system for data medium exchange, or if the receiver operating system prefers to read formatting of other operating systems (eg not all Unix operating systems can read in NTFS data carriers), then all files can , as they were at the sender, be restored. This is sufficient for information that is not subject to any further formatting as done by most application programs (eg word processors).
* Application software:
 If application programs were used to create the files to be transferred, it is important to ensure that these programs are identical in terms of their versions, since the file formats may differ. The version equality need not exist if the program versions are upwards or downwards compatible.
* Security software and security parameters:
 In addition, if security products or protection mechanisms of certain application programs are used, the compatibility of these products must be ensured.
 The sender and the recipient must communicate in an appropriate way about the keys or passwords used.
If incompatibilities arise, additional arrangements or products must be provided which provide for appropriate conversion, or the sender and receiver systems are to be equipped appropriately.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M12 Appropriate marking of data carriers during shipping [user]In the case of sufficient labeling of data carriers to be exchanged, care must be taken to ensure that sender and (all) recipients are immediately identifiable. The identification of the data carrier or its packaging must clearly identify the contents of the data carrier for the recipient. However, in the case of information worthy of protection, it is important that this labeling does not allow unauthorized persons to infer the nature and content of the stored information.

For classified information, the applicable security regulations must always be adhered to.

In addition, the data carriers should be marked with the formats used or the parameters required for readout. For example, when transmitting DVDs, it must be noted, among other things, whether they are video, audio or data DVDs. Other useful tags may be the date of shipment or creation of the data, any version numbers or ordinal features.

### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### OPS.1.2.3.M13 Encryption and Digital Signatures [User] (CI)

** Use of encryption, checksums or digital signatures **

If confidential or high-integrity information is transferred and there is some possibility that such data may be compromised, manipulated or altered by unauthorized persons, a cryptographic process should be used to protect the data for transport or transmission become.

** Confidentiality protection by encryption **

Confidential information should be encrypted before transmission. The decisive feature of an encryption method is the quality of the algorithm as well as the key selection. A recognized algorithm that is sufficient for normal protection needs is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), see also CON.1 Crypto Concept.

In order to meet the confidentiality requirements of the information to be transmitted, the sender's and the recipient's IT system must sufficiently ensure access protection to the encryption program. If necessary, this program should be stored on a removable medium, usually kept locked and only played back when needed and used.

** Integrity protection through checksums, encryption or digital signature formation **

If only the integrity of the data to be transmitted is to be ensured for the exchange of data, a distinction must be made as to whether protection should be provided only against accidental changes, such as: B. by transmission errors, or against manipulation should be made. If only random changes are to be detected, checksum methods (eg Cyclic Redundancy Checks) or error-correcting codes can be used. In addition, protection against manipulation is provided by methods which generate a so-called message authentication code (MAC) from the information to be transmitted by using a symmetrical encryption algorithm (eg triple DES). Other methods use an asymmetric encryption algorithm (eg RSA) in combination with a hash function and generate a "digital signature". The respective generated "fingerprints" (checksum, error correcting codes, MAC, digital signature) are transmitted together with the information to the receiver and can be checked by the latter.Further information on the use of cryptographic methods and products can be found in the module CON.1 Crypto Concept.

** suitable key management **

The use of cryptographic security mechanisms (eg encryption, digital signature) requires the confidential, integrity and authentic generation, distribution and installation of appropriate keys. Keys that have come to the attention of unauthorized persons who have been misrepresented in distribution or even come from an uncontrolled source (this also applies to the key agreement between communication partners) can compromise the cryptographic security mechanism as well as bad quality keys that have been improperly generated , Qualitatively good keys are usually generated using suitable key generators. For key management, the following points should be noted:

* Key generation: Key generation should be done in a secure environment using appropriate key generators.
* Key separation: Cryptographic keys should, if possible, serve only one purpose. In particular, keys other than encryption should always be used for encryption.
* Key distribution / key exchange: The communication partners must have matching cryptographic keys. For this, all communication partners must be supplied with the necessary keys. Key installation and storage: In the course of the key installation, the authentic origin as well as the integrity of the key data must be checked. Generally, keys should never be stored in clear form, but always encrypted in the system. In any case, it must be ensured that pre-set keys are changed during the installation of the encryption process.
* Key archiving: For archiving purposes, the cryptographic key material should also be storable outside the crypto module in an encrypted form and, if necessary, readable again.
* Access and Representation Policy: Access and proxy rights should be regulated. Appropriate mechanisms must be supported by key management and the crypto modules and devices to be deployed (eg, key deposit in case of an employee leaving the company or being out of health for a long time).
* Key change: In the crypto policy, it must be determined based on the security policy, when and how often keys must be changed.
* Key destruction: Keys that are no longer required (eg keys whose validity period has expired) must be securely deleted or destroyed (eg by multiple deletions / overwrites and / or mechanical destruction of the data medium).
#### OPS.1.2.3.M14 Disk Management [Head of Organization, IT Operations] (CIA)

For higher protection needs, a disk management should be set up to ensure access to disk to the required extent and within a reasonable time. This requires a regular management of the data carriers, which requires uniform labeling and inventory management. Furthermore, in the context of data carrier management, the proper handling and storage of the data carriers, their proper use and transport and, last but not least, the deletion or destruction of the data carriers must be ensured. For analog media, most institutions have a well-established and proven policy for their administrations, namely the classic file management. Therefore, in this measure the digital data carriers are placed in the foreground, but the individual recommendations apply mutatis mutandis to all types of data carriers.** Inventories ** provide fast and targeted access to media. Inventories, for example, provide information about repository, retention period, authorized recipients.

The external identification of data media enables their rapid identification. However, the marking should not allow unauthorized persons to identify the content (eg the marking of a magnetic tape with the keyword "telephone charges") in order to make it more difficult to misuse. A defined structure of identification features (eg date, filing structure, serial number) facilitates the assignment to stock records.

For the proper handling of data carriers, the manufacturer's instructions, which can usually be found on the packaging, are to be used. With regard to the storage of data storage devices on the one hand measures for storage (magnetic field / dust-proof, climate-friendly) and on the other hand measures to prevent unauthorized access (suitable containers, cabinets, rooms) to make.

The shipping or transport of data media must be carried out in such a way that damage to the data carrier can be excluded as possible (eg magnetic tape mailing, air-cushioned envelopes). The packaging of the data carrier must be aligned with its need for protection (eg by means of lockable transport containers). Shipment or transport methods (eg courier transport) must be defined in the same way as the proof of delivery procedure (eg accompanying note, dispatch notes) and receipt at the consignee (eg acknowledgment of receipt). The data carrier must not contain any "residual data" beyond the data to be sent. This can be achieved by physical deletion. If no tools are available for this, the data carrier should at least be formatted. It should be ensured that it is not possible to reverse the command with the underlying operating system.

It should also be noted that a backup copy is created before the delivery of important data carriers. ,

For the internal transfer of data carriers, regulations can be made such as acknowledgment procedures, pick-up / take-along authorizations as well as the keeping of inventories of the whereabouts of data carriers.

In the event that ** data carriers obtained from third parties ** are used, provisions must be made regarding their treatment before use. If, for example, digital data are transmitted, a computer virus check of the data carrier or data records should generally take place. This also applies accordingly before the first use of new digital data carriers. It is recommended to check for computer viruses not only when receiving but also before sending digital media.

A regulated procedure for the deletion or destruction of data carriers prevents the misuse of the stored data. Before re-using any media, the stored data must be completely deleted (see OPS.1.18 Deleting and destroying data).

#### OPS.1.2.3.M15 Secure shipping method and packaging [Post Office, User] (C)

For information with increased protection needs, it should be examined how these can be adequately protected during a data medium exchange. For this purpose, a shipping method and packaging appropriate to the protection needs must be selected by the shipper. For example, one way to send information that requires high-security information is to use trusted couriers. Basically, the data should be encrypted.

In addition to the implementation notes outlined in OPS.1.2.3.M14 Disk Management, the shipping packaging of data carriers should be such that any manipulation of the data media can be detected by changes to the packaging.

Possible measures are the use of

* Envelopes with seals,
* sealed containers,* Envelopes that are pasted over with adhesive film and then repeatedly over-drawn with non-water-soluble ink,
* Security labels used to seal the envelopes.
For the secret protection area, there are special, security-certified security envelopes, sealing tapes and security labels.

If digital data carriers have read-only protection (eg slider for floppy disks, write ring for tapes), this should be used. Depending on the protection requirements of the data stored on the data carriers, it should be checked which of the following security mechanisms are appropriate:

* The files should be stored as read-only on the data carriers. For this example, the existing in many Office programs access protection can be used (see also APP.5.2 Office applications).
* If you want to be able to detect manipulation of the information on the data carrier itself, use encryption or checksum procedures (see OPS.1.2.3.M13 Encryption and digital signatures).
* To prevent unauthorized reading, the entire data carrier or the individual files should be encrypted.
#### OPS.1.2.3.M16 Secure Storage of Media Before and After Shipping [User, Post Office] (CIA)

Before sending a data carrier, you must ensure that there is sufficient access protection for the period between the storage of the data on the data medium and the transport. Described volumes should be kept in a safe place so that only authorized users can access them, whether they are analogue or digital. If the data to be transmitted is confidential, the data carriers on which they are located must be stored in appropriate containers (cupboard, safe) until they are transported. The persons responsible for the transport or for the delivery (eg post office) are to be informed about proper and safe storage and handling of the data media.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M17 Verifying Media Before Shipping [User] (CI)

Before sending a data carrier, it must be checked to see if the desired information - and only this information - can be reconstructed from the data medium. This is to be controlled both with documents as well as with electronic data carriers. Letters and other analog media should also be re-examined prior to shipping to see if they are complete and contain no additional information that should not be shared. This is especially important if, for reasons of confidentiality, parts of transactions, such as attributions, may not be transmitted to third parties. For this purpose, this partial information z. B. be made unrecognizable by blackening. However, as blackened information can often be made readable again without much effort, it is better to remove it altogether from the events, eg. By deleting them in a copy of the source file before printing. Depending on the protection requirements of the information, there are various methods for this:

* Documents should be structured as much as possible so that non-public content can be easily separated, e.g. By only appearing in an attachment. The attachment should then be available electronically in a separate file classified as confidential.* If the documents are already in a form that does not allow for a clean separation of confidentiality, sensitive content must be removed prior to disclosure. A basic problem is to identify and carefully remove all sensitive information. Since this often does not work in practice, it should be avoided if possible to pass on such documents "defused". If this is necessary anyway, all critical information must be removed and the security levels of the affected documents redefined. In any case, before releasing the documents, a renewed approval process must be carried out.
* For paper documents, sensitive information is often blacked out. This is to be done in the following steps:

 
+ First, on a paper copy, all critical information must be carefully and sufficiently blackened.
+ Then these blackened documents are copied.
+ After that it is checked if the blackened passages on the copy are actually not readable.
+ If this is assured and the release has been granted, the copy can be shared. The blackened original may under no circumstances be published, as blackened passages on the original can often be made easily readable again.


 
* In order to remove confidential information in electronic documents, the passages requiring protection must first be replaced by other symbols and then blackened. For this purpose, strings of fixed length should be used, for example "XXXXXXXXXX", so that the original meaning can no longer be guessed. Before distribution, the files should be checked to see if they contain any residual information, such as: Eg previous revision statuses (see also OPS.1.2.3.M9 Removal of Remaining Information in Files prior to Redistribution [User]).
Electronic data carriers must be physically erased before further use if other data was previously stored on them (see OPS.1.2.3.M8 Physical deletion of data carriers before and after use).

The correct transmission can be checked on electronic data carriers by using a program that compares the original with the transmitted file character by character.

Before shipping, all filenames on the media should be listed to check against the names that only the files intended for the recipient are contained on those media.

#### OPS.1.2.3.M18 Backup copy of submitted data [user] (A)

If the data to be transmitted has been created or compiled solely for the purpose of data transmission and is not stored on another medium, a backup copy of this data should be provided. In case of loss or damage of the data during the transport, the shipment can be made again with little effort.
