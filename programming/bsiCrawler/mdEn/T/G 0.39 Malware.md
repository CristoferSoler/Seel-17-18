G 0.39 Malware
=====================

A malicious program is software designed to perform unwanted and often malicious functions. Among the typical types of malicious programs include viruses, worms and Trojan horses. Malicious programs are usually secretly active without the knowledge and consent of the user.

Malicious programs today offer an attacker extensive communication and control options and have a variety of functions. Among other things, malicious programs can specifically search passwords, remotely control systems, deactivate protection software and spy on data.

In particular, loss or falsification of information or applications is of paramount importance. But the loss of image and the financial damage caused by malicious programs are also of great importance.

Examples:

* In the past, the W32 / Bugbear malware spread in two ways: locating and copying in local networks for shared-access computers. It also sent itself as an HTML e-mail to recipients in the e-mail address book of infested computers. Due to an error in the HTML routine of certain e-mail programs, the malicious program was executed there when the message was opened without any further action on the part of the recipient.
* The malicious program W32 / Klez spread in different variants. Infested computers sent the virus to all recipients in the computer's e-mail address book. If this virus had infested a computer, it prevented the installation of virus protection programs of common manufacturers by continuous manipulations on the operating system and thus made the disinfection of the affected computers considerably more difficult.
