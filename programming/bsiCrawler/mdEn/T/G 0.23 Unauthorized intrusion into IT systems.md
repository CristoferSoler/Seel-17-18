G 0.23 Unauthorized intrusion into IT systems
==========================================

Basically, any interface to an IT system not only includes the ability to legitimately use certain services of the IT system, but also the risk of unauthorized access to the IT system.

Examples:

* If a user ID and the corresponding password are spied out, an unauthorized use of the protected applications or IT systems is conceivable.
* Hackers could gain unauthorized access to IT systems via inadequately secured remote maintenance access.
* In the case of insufficiently secured interfaces of active network components, it is conceivable that attackers gain unauthorized access to the network component. If they also succeed in overcoming the local security mechanisms, e.g. administrative privileges, they could perform all administrative activities.
Many IT systems have interfaces for the use of removable data storage, such as: B. additional memory cards or USB storage media. In the case of an unattended IT system with the corresponding hardware and software, there is a risk that unauthorized reading of large amounts of data or the introduction of malicious programs can occur.
