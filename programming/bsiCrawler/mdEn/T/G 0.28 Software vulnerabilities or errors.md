G 0.28 Software vulnerabilities or errors
===========================================

For any software, the more complex it is, the more often errors occur. Even with intensive tests, not all errors are usually discovered before delivery to the customer. If software errors are not detected in time, the crashes or errors that occur during the application can lead to far-reaching consequences. Examples include incorrect calculation results, wrong management decisions, and business process delays.

Software vulnerabilities or errors can lead to serious security vulnerabilities in an application, an IT system or all IT systems connected to it. Such vulnerabilities may be exploited by attackers to infiltrate malicious software, unauthorized read data or manipulation.

Examples:

* Most Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) alerts in recent years have been related to security-related programming errors. These are errors that arise when creating software and cause this software to be misused by attackers. Much of these bugs were caused by buffer overflows.
* Internet browsers today are an important software component on clients. Browsers are often used not only for accessing the Internet, but also for internal web applications in companies and government agencies. Software vulnerabilities or bugs in browsers can therefore significantly affect information security overall.
