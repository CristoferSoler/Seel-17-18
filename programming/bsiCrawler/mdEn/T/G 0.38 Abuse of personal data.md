G 0.38 Abuse of personal data
=========================================

Personal data are almost always particularly sensitive information. Typical examples are details of personal or material circumstances of a specific or identifiable natural person. If the protection of personal data is not adequately ensured, there is a risk that the data subject will be affected in his or her social position or economic circumstances.

Abuse of personal data may, for example, be the case if an institution collects too much personal data, has collected them without legal basis or consent, uses them for a purpose other than that permitted for the purpose of collection, deletes personal data too late or passes them on without authorization.

Examples:

* Personal data may only be processed for the purpose for which it was collected or first stored. It is therefore inadmissible to use log files in which users log in and log out of IT systems solely for access control for presence and behavior control.
* Persons who have access to personal data could pass them on without authorization. For example, an employee at a hotel reception might sell the credentials of guests to advertising companies.
