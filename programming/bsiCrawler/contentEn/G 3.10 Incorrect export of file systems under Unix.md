#G 3.10 Incorrect export of file systems under Unix
Exported disks can be mounted from any machine that logs in with the name given in the / etc / exports or / etc / dfs / dfstab file. The user of this computer can take any UID  and GID. Unless directories have been exported with the root = option, UID 0 (root) is an exception that typically maps to another UID (for example, the user nobody or anonymous) when accessing an NFS server becomes. Therefore only files that belong to root can be protected.

The use of the NFSfor exporting file systems and the distribution of system files usingNISare not adequately protected in protected environments. The use thus represents a threat to the integrity of the systems.

Stand: 1st EL as of January 2000
