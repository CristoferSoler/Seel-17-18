#G 2.93 Insufficient emergency preparedness concept for outsourcing or cloud use
Outsourcing in the area of ??emergency preparedness has serious consequences when it comes to outsourcing or using cloud services. Additional difficulties arise because problems can generally be divided into three critical areas:

* IT systems at the client
* IT systems at outsourcing or cloud service providers
* Interfaces (eg network connection, routers, telecommunication providers) between client and service provider


In the case of a fault, it must first be located correctly, which is difficult depending on the type of fault, since different errors can lead to the same symptoms, for example failure of the communication connection and failure of a system at the service provider. Only after the fault has been identified can meaningful emergency measures be initiated.

In the event of a partial or complete failure, the absence of contingency plans for the IT systems of the client or service provider as well as the interfaces always leads to unnecessarily long downtimes with corresponding consequences for the client's productivity or service , In addition, the poor coordination of emergency scenarios between the client and the service provider can lead to gaps in emergency preparedness.
