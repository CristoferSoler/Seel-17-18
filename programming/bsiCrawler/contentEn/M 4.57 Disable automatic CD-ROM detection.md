#M 4.57 Disable automatic CD-ROM detection
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

Under Windows, CD-ROMs can be automatically detected and edited. As a result, programs stored on the CD-ROM can also be automatically executed on the computer. The automatic CD-ROM recognition should therefore be permanently stopped.

In Windows 95, on the tab GER TEMANAGER under the system control option SYSTEM for the CD-ROM the property Automatic notification on change is deactivated.

For Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, to permanently disable automatic CD-ROM discovery in the registry, the Autorun entry in the SYSTEM / CurrentControlSet / Services / CD-ROM key in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE section is set to REG_WORD  = To set  0. In Windows XP, this can also be done by setting the Computer Configuration | Administrative Templates | System | Deactivate autoplay to the value All drives. Disabling automatic CD-ROM detection can also be done on a per-user basis (User Configuration | Administrative Templates | System | Disable Autoplay policy). Policies can be defined in both local and Active Directory-based group policies.

If automatic CD-ROM detection is not generally disabled, this should be documented. In individual cases, the automatic CD-ROM recognition can be prevented for each CD-ROM individually by pressing the shift key during insertion. However, experience has shown that this is rarely done in practice.
