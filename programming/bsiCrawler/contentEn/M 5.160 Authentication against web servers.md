#M 5.160 Authentication against web servers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to determine the identity of users and assign rights to them, there are different mechanisms that are presented in the following sections. If a user has successfully authenticated himself (for example, by specifying the user name and password), he is assigned a so-called session. A session is a session associated with a user and refers to an active connection established to the server. Sessions are necessary because the protocol used in web applications (HTTP) is stateless. Each request to a web server is processed independently of any other previously received requests. In order to be able to depict user-dependent conditions for web offers (eg the log-on status of a user or the content of a shopping basket), sessions are used.

A session is identified by a unique session ID. This will be transferred to the client after a successful login and will be sent back to the server with every further request. This tells the web server that the request is in a specific context and can be assigned to a user.
