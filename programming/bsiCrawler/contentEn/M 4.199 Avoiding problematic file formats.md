E-mail is now the main transmission path for malicious software. A purely text-based e-mail without attachments is harmless. It only becomes dangerous when e-mail attachments are executed, the e-mail is HTML-based or the e-mail recipients are lured to manipulated websites via links in the e-mail (see below) ). In principle, e-mail attachments of any kind and quantity can be added. An excessive number of attachments can affect the availability of an e-mail client or the e-mail server (see G5.75 Overloading of incoming e-mails). The greater danger, however, are attachments that contain executable code and can thus trigger unexpected side effects.



## Examples 
* As far as harmless so far valid ASCII, GIF, JPEG formated files.
