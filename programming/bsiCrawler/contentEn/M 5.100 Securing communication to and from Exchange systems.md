#M 5.100 Securing communication to and from Exchange systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

A groupware server communicates with groupware clients, browsers, telephony and communication applications and other groupware systems. There is also a data exchange between individual groupware system components. Communication takes place via the local network and / or external networks. In all cases, data is transmitted, which must be protected. This is not only the data that is used to authenticate users (eg username and password), but also business information and personal data in the home environment.

It must therefore be decided with which protective mechanisms the communication is secured.

When transferring valuable data to and from groupware systems, they should be encrypted as much as possible. Various methods can be used to protect the data. It therefore has to be decided which method is the most favorable under cost-benefit aspects. The decision is comprehensible to document.



## Examples 
* At the physical level, link encryption is feasible but generally impractical.
* At the network level, the establishment of a virtual private network (VPN) is possible.
