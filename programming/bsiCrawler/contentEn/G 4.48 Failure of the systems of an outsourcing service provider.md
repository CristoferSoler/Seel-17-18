#G 4.48 Failure of the systems of an outsourcing service provider
With an outsourcing service provider, the IT systems can partially or completely fail, which also affects the client.

Even if the IT failure only affects some systems or applications, this can lead to data processing being inconsistent or incorrectly executed.

It should also be borne in mind that in the event of inadequate structuring or isolation of the service provider's IT systems, the failure of a system that is not assigned to the customer can still lead to the client's IT operations being impaired is canceled. This can always be a problem when individual IT components (eg host computers, firewalls) are shared for different clients of the service provider. In that case, an error in the database of any outsourcing service provider's customer may mean that, for example, in host processing, the batch processing of several customers has to be discontinued if it is configured badly or incorrectly.

Similar problems arise when the connection between outsourced organization and outsourcing service provider is completed.
