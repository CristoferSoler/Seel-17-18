#G 2.143 Information loss when copying or moving data to Samba shares
In many cases, Samba is used as a file server for Windows systems. Windows (as of Windows NT) uses the New Technology File System (NTFS) as file system by default. Samba in turn uses the file system of the underlying Unix operating system to manage the data. The file systems used by Windows and Unix are sometimes very different.

File systems used by Unix-like operating systems, such as third-extended file system (ext3) or journaled file system (JFS), can not fully mimic certain properties of NTFS. Samba can usually compensate for these differences, but in some cases Samba can not directly take into account properties of NTFS file system objects. When copying or moving file system objects across system boundaries (for example, from a Windows XP system to a file share on a Samba server), information may be lost if administrators are unaware of such effects.

The following information can be affected by the loss:

* Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
* DOS attributes
