#M 1.66 Observance of standards in IT cabling
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT

The term application neutral communication cable systems was used for the first time in 1995 to publish a standard describing the topology and classification of transmission links with defined characteristics as well as a uniform interface for connecting the terminal devices. These specifications are not only valid for use in office buildings, but can also be transferred to other areas of application.

Under the responsibility of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), the standards will be monitored, agreed with the International Committees (ISO / IEC) and further developed and refined as necessary.

The standards support users in the phases of building design, cabling design, planning, implementation and operation of communication cable systems.

In addition to the EN 50173-1 - Application neutral communication cable systems, General requirements, as well as the Drafts 2 B & B building, 3 Industrial buildings, 4 residential units and 5 datacenters available as draft at the time of writing, there are other standards in place planning and execution of IT cabling.

Transferred to the phase model of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogs, standards can be assigned as follows:



## Examples 
* EN 50310 - Application of measures for earthing and equipotential bonding in buildings with information technology equipment5.2: Common equipotential bonding system (CBN) in a building 6.3: AC distribution and connection of the protective conductor (TN-S)
