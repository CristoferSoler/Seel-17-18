Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

In order to be able to analyze an existing network in a safety-related manner, it is necessary to take stock of the current network situation. It is also required when extending an existing network. When planning networks, the points described below should be taken into account in the design.

For this purpose, an actual recording with accompanying documentation of the following aspects, which are partly based on each other, necessary:

* physical network topology,
* logical network topology,
* used network protocols,
* Communications in the LAN and WAN as well as
* Network performance and traffic flow.


In the individual steps, essentially the following must be stated:



## Examples 
* the current cable routing (see also M 5.4 documentation and labeling of the cabling and M 2.396 specifications for the documentation and labeling of the IT cabling as well as M 1.69 cabling in server rooms),
* the types of cables used and the corresponding cable lengths (see M 5.3 Selection of suitable cable types from a communication point of view) and the specified requirements for the protection of cables (see M 1.22 Material protection of cables and distributors) and
* IT systems, d. h.Client and server computers, active network components (such as routers, switches, WLAN access points), network printers, etc.
