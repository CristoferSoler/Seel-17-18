#G 4.4 Conduction impairment due to environmental factors
The transmission characteristics of cables with electrical signal transmission can be adversely affected by electrical and magnetic fields. Whether this leads to an actual disturbance of the signal transmission depends essentially on the following factors:

* Frequency range, strength and duration of action,
* Shielding the cable and
* Protective measures during data transmission (redundancy, error correction).


Many impairments can be identified in advance:

* Along heavy current lines and in the area of ??large motors, strong inductive fields are created (railway, production plant, elevator).
* In the field of transmitting equipment strong electromagnetic fields exist (broadcasting, police or fire department radio, radio service, paging systems, radio networks).
* Due to their transmitting power, mobile phones in certain cases exceed the sensitivity of IT systems.
* Cables affect each other through mutual induction.


Irrespective of the purely electrical or magnetic influences, additional environmental factors can affect a cable:

* high temperatures (for example in industrial production areas),
* aggressive gases and
* high mechanical loads (eg for temporary installation on the floor or for cables to moving equipment).
