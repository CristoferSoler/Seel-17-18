#G 5.99 Evaluation of connection data when using mobile phones
In the case of mobile communication, it is not physically possible on the radio link to prevent the transmitted signals from being listened to unauthorized and recorded with corresponding technical effort. Therefore, an attacker would not have the access problem known in wireline communication.

A second problem, which generally occurs in most radio services, results from the fact that the mobile communication partners have to be located for technical reasons in order to be reachable.

If they set up a connection themselves, they also provide information about their location during connection setup. This location information could be used by the network operator or service operator to create motion profiles.

Most mobile phones and smartphones have implemented the so-called Radio Resource Location Services Protocol (RRLP), which is the location of a mobile subscriber for emergency calls and can even use the possibly built-GPS receiver for more accurate location.

As a rule, RRLP can not be switched off. This information is available from the network operator.
