#M 4.83 Update / upgrade of software and hardware in the network area
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

By updating software, vulnerabilities can be eliminated or functions expanded. This concerns, for example, the operating software of active network components such as eg. Switches or routers, but also a network management software. An update is particularly necessary if vulnerabilities become known that affect the secure operation of the network, if malfunctions occur repeatedly or a functional extension for safety or technical requirements is necessary.

Also, an upgrade of hardware can be useful in certain cases, if z. B. a new version of a switch offers a higher transfer and filtering rate. These measures may increase the degree of availability, integrity, and confidentiality under some circumstances.

However, before upgrading or updating, the functionality, interoperability, and reliability of the new components must be thoroughly tested. This is best done in a physically separate test network before the update or upgrade is put into productive use (see M 4.78 Careful implementation of configuration changes).
