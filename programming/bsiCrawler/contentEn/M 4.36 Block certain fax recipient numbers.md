#M 4.36 Block certain fax recipient numbers
Initiation Initiation: IT Security Officer, Supervisor

Responsible for implementation: fax officer, fax post office

If there is a need to prevent the accidental or deliberate sending of information or documents by fax to a non-desired recipient's number, today's technology offers at least three solutions:

With some fax machines or fax servers it is possible to prevent the sending of faxes to certain fax recipient numbers (positive exclusion) or alternatively to block all recipient phone numbers except some selected numbers (negative exclusion ).

The same type of authorization can be achieved in modern PBX systems, provided that the fax machine is connected to the telephone network via such a system.

If a fax machine or the PBX does not offer such an option, the public network operator can, for example, rent an additional device which prevents the connection to certain telephone numbers (positive and negative exclusion).
