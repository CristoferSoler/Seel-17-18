#G 5.185 Obtaining physical access to SAN switches
If an institution has insufficient access controls to the components of a storage solution or if they are lacking, an attacker can gain physical access to existing switches or connect additional FC SAN switches to the network ,

Behind such an attack may hide the following intentions that pose a threat to the institution:

* The goal of an access could be to allow the attacker to access the distributed zoning database in order to change it so that it can access the storage systems.
* Additional FC SAN switches are looped into the data stream to clip data, for example, by changing the FC routing.
* The name Server Database is changed so that an attacker acts as a target system and can thus intercept the data of the initiators.
* WWN spoofing as the basis for further attacks (see B.G 5.186 Access to information from other clients through WWN spoofing)


In addition, physical access to components of the storage solution may be made with the intention of performing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The attacker has different variants of the manipulation available:

* Switch off individual components
* Replace or remove plugged cables
* Violation of the bending radii of cables in order to disturb the data transfer or to completely prevent the data transfer
* Send Reconfigure Fabric (RCF) messages to disrupt normal traffic
