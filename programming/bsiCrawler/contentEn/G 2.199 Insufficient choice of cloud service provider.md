#G 2.199 Insufficient choice of cloud service provider
Once an institution has made the strategic decision to use cloud services, it always places it in a relationship of loyalty with the chosen cloud service provider. Failure to choose the service provider with particular care and adherence to the established cloud usage strategy may result in a negative impact on the institution over a long period of time.

Often when choosing the cloud service provider important factors such as its reputation, provider rankings, publicly available service specifications of service providers, obligations to comply with laws and policies or certifications acquired or not sufficiently taken into account. The cloud market is not very transparent for clients, there are no standardized offers from cloud service providers.

This may result in security issues with the cloud service provider (for example, poor availability). These are often associated with financial losses for the using institution, if it depends on the availability of the service, in order to be able to provide a service on its part.
