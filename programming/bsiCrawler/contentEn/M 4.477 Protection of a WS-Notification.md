#M 4.477 Protection of a WS-Notification
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

A NotificationBroker is responsible for delivering a message (notification). For this purpose, it only evaluates the topic of the message. The actual contents of the broker is not interested. For this reason, for example, the content of a message can be completely encrypted without this posing a problem for the broker.

In order to protect messages from manipulation, they should at least be signed. This must be done across all content and, in the case of an XML tag, also for the label attribute in the protocol header.

If necessary, to protect confidentiality, additional elements in the body area of ??the message (SOAPbody) can be encrypted by the sender.
