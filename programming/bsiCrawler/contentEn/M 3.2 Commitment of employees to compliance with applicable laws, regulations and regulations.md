#M 3.2 Commitment of employees to compliance with applicable laws, regulations and regulations
Responsible for initiation: Data Protection Officer, IT Security Officer, Head of Human Resources

Responsible for implementation: Human Resources, Supervisors

Employees should be required to comply with applicable laws (eg data protection), regulations and internal regulations. This should make new employees familiar with the existing rules and regulations around the topic of information security and at the same time motivate them to comply. It makes sense not only to carry out the obligation, but also to hand over the required copies of the regulations and regulations and to have the receipt acknowledged or to keep the employees in a central place for constant inspection. New laws and regulations should be appropriately pointed out, eg. Via the intranet.

All employees should be advised that all work results and all information received during the work are for internal and official use only. In addition, employees should be made aware that they are checking that it is permissible before disclosing any personal or confidential information. This also applies to data that is licensed or protected by copyright.
