#G 2.205 Missing emergency preparedness concept for service-oriented architectures
If Service Providers fail in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and no alternative providers are available, operations may be disrupted, which may seriously affect business processes. Information security can be extremely vulnerable because, for example, important security components are involved. In this case, if a security or emergency precautionary concept is lacking which takes into account the special features of a SOA, suitable security measures may not be carried out in a timely manner and there is a threat of considerable damage for the institution.
