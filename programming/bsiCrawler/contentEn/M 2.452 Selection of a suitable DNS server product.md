Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

When procuring new DNS server products, it is possible to select them in such a way that only minor personnel, technical and organizational expenses are necessary in the later operation in order to achieve a high degree of security , In addition, different DNS server products offer different performance and different ease of use. When purchasing, the following aspects should be considered.

* The DNS server product should already have proven itself in practice.
* If enough trained personnel are available for a particular product and all functionality requirements are met, this DNS server product should be used.
* There are DNS server products whose implementation differs from the standards to DNS (RFC1034, 1035 etc.). In particular, if the use of various DNS server products is planned to avoid software monocultures, this should only be done after a compatibility check.
* If DNSSEC is used, care must be taken to ensure that this technology is supported by the DNS server product.




## Examples 
* Is there enough trained personnel for the selected DNS server product?
* To what extent does the DNS server product help the administrator create syntactically correct master files?
