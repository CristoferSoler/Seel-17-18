#G 5.190 Abuse of services
Cloud services commissioned by an institution may be abused by attackers under circumstances of attackers. Such abuse is usually attributed to the original client. This can lead to financial losses and reputation losses for the cloud user.

If third-party services are abused, this is usually for the purpose of performing one or more of the following illegal activities:

* Sending spam messages
* Operating botnets
* Obscuring the origin of further illegal activities
* Hosting malicious software
* Free use of the service for your own purposes


In principle, the misuse of cloud services by third parties can be done in several ways. An attacker can, for example, gain access to the service via the interfaces used (see G 5.89 Hijacking of network connections). Vulnerabilities in web interfaces or protocols that are used by the connected clients also pose a risk. Furthermore, the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the technical realization of the cloud service is conceivable. For example, if there is no or only insufficient validation of users (for example, by verifying the given e-mail address), this will make it possible to compromise the cloud service by hackers or spammers or to host malicious software.
