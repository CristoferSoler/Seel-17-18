#M 4.384 Secure configuration of OpenLDAP
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

This procedure describes how to properly configure the slapd server to perform its intended tasks safely. In order to ensure the security of a directory service's data, the client applications used must also be configured securely. This may or may not be the ldap * tools of OpenLDAP. The variety of available tools can not be addressed in the IT-Grundschutz Catalogs. It is therefore all the more important to configure the slapd server securely in order not to have to rely on the security settings of the clients used.



## Examples 
* suffix or olcSuffix (database directive)
