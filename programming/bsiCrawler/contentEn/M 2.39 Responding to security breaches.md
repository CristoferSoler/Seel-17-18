Investigations should be made to determine how and where the injury occurred. Subsequently, the appropriate remedial or mitigating measures must be carried out. If necessary, additional damage prevention measures must be taken. The actions to be taken depend on the nature of the injury as well as the source.

It must be regulated who is responsible for contacts with other organizations to obtain information about known vulnerabilities (see also M 2.35 Obtaining information about security gaps in the system) or to provide information about any security gaps that have occurred , Care must be taken that eventually. Affected areas are informed as quickly as possible (see block B 1.8 treatment of security incidents).
