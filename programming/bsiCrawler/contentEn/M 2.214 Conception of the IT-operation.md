#M 2.214 Conception of the IT-operation
Responsible for initiation: Public authorities / management, IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

In order to ensure a proper and secure IT operation, a comprehensive conception is indispensable. There should be regulations or requirements for the use of IT systems and IT products in the various areas, which are well coordinated and reflect the security objectives of the agency or the company.



## Examples 
* The information processing must be continuously documented in all its phases, all applications and all systems (see M 2.219 Continuous documentation of information processing).
* Access to all IT systems should be protected, eg. By passwords.
* The functions of those IT components which should not or should not be used are to be blocked if possible (see also M4.95 Minimum Operating System).
* The logging files should be regularly checked for anomalies (eg execution of functions which should not be used).
* As far as possible, the IT systems should be subject to an integrity test at intervals so that unauthorized changes can be detected as early as possible. This is especially true for configuration data.
* For all IT systems, suitable data backup procedures should be used.
* Compliance with the safety measures must be checked regularly (see M 2.199 Maintenance of information security).
