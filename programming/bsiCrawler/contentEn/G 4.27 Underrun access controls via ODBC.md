#G 4.27 Underrun access controls via ODBC
Database interfaces provide the user with an application programming interface (API) application program to other databases in the form of drivers.

Examples of database interfaces are:

* ODBC: Open Database Connectivity
* IDAPI: Integrated Database Application Programming Interface
* JDBC: Java Database Connectivity


The instructions of the application program are translated by the database interface into commands specific to the respective database, transmitted to the database and the results are transmitted back to the application program.

Part of the communication The interface between the application program and the database identifies the application as a registered database user.

Existing access or access controls on a database can be undermined if the database is accessed through database interfaces and errors have occurred during the installation, configuration, or use of its drivers. In this case, the protection of confidential data can not be guaranteed and the manipulation of data is possible.
