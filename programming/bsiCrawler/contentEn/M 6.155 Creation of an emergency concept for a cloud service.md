Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, IT security officer, IT manager

The creation of an IT emergency concept for the internal processes in cloud use is an important measure for emergency preparedness. As part of the emergency concept, both organizational and technical aspects should be addressed.



## Examples 
* Is there an emergency concept for the cloud services used, which includes both organizational and technical aspects?
* Does the emergency plan contain all necessary information on responsibilities and contact persons?
* Have detailed regulations been made regarding data backups?
* Were specifications for the redundant design of management tools and interface systems recorded?
