#M 2.507 Organizational procedures to ensure the rights of data subjects in the processing of personal data
Responsible for initiation: Data protection officer, specialist responsible

Responsible for implementation: Data protection officer, specialist responsible

Technological-organizational procedures shall be developed to ensure the enforcement of data subjects' rights to access, rectification, blocking, erasure and access to file or procedural directories (where such directories are required).

These procedures should be such that the rights of those concerned can be implemented quickly and appropriately.



## Examples 
* A method for processing personal data includes an evaluation program or a menu item with the aid of which a complete print-out of the data stored by the person concerned is generated.
* A procedure directory is automated with the help of a database in such a way that a very simple access to the extensive database is possible via certain keywords and thus all cross references can be recognized.
