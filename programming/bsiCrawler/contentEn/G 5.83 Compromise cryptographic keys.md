#G 5.83 Compromise cryptographic keys
When using cryptographic methods, the gain in security crucially depends on how confidential the secret cryptographic keys used remain. With knowledge of both the key used and the crypto method used, it is usually easy to reverse the encryption and to gain the clear text. Therefore, a potential attacker will try to identify the keys used. Attack points are:

* In key generation, inappropriate methods are used, for example for the determination of random numbers or for the derivation of the keys.
* During key generation, keys are read before they are stored on secure storage media.
* During operation, keys from crypto modules are read out by technical attacks.
* Keys deposited as backups are stolen.
* When entering cryptographic keys, the keys are spied out.
* The crypto processes used are broken. For example, in symmetric encryption methods such as the DES, it is now possible to determine the key used by means of massively parallel computers by trial and error (brute force attack).
* Used cryptographic keys are betrayed by inside.
