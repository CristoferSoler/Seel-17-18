#M 4.1 Password protection for IT systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: users

The password protection of an IT system should ensure that only such users have access to the data and IT applications that can prove their authorization. Immediately after switching on the IT system, the credentials must be provided. If the user can not prove the required authorization, password protection prevents access to the IT system.

Password protection can be implemented on an IT system in various ways:

* Most BIOS variants offer the installation of a boot password. If you make a mistake, the boot process will not continue. A BIOS password is not difficult to overcome, but protects against random storms, so at least should be used wherever there are no better access protection mechanisms are (see also: M 4.84 use of the BIOS security mechanisms).
* Good operating systems already contain access protection mechanisms. In most cases, these must still be activated, for example by assigning passwords for all users. More details can be found in the operating system-specific blocks.
* Additional hardware or software is installed which queries a password before the actual start of the computer and prevents further use of the IT system if the password is entered incorrectly.


For the handling of passwords, the instructions in M 2.11 Regulating password usage must be observed. In particular, the password must be changed regularly.
