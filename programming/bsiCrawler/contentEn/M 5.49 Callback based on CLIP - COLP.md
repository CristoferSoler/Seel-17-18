#M 5.49 Callback based on CLIP / COLP
Responsible for Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Many communication cards offer the option of automatic callback. If this option is activated, the communication card, when it receives a call, immediately disconnects after a successful connection and retrieves a preset number. This prevents an unauthorized caller from abusing this remote access unless it is reachable at the preset number. Callback is always to be used if a fixed communication partner is to be able to dial in automatically. It should be noted that the automatic callback also covers the costs of data transmission.

With the aid of the ISDN, a variant of the callback to a fixed telephone number is possible: The addressed ISDN card checks with the aid of the ISDN feature Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP), from which point the connection request was made, and compares the transmitted Phone number with a phone number table. If a valid telephone number was transmitted via CLIP, the telephone number stored in the telephone number table is called back.

It is advantageous compared to the exclusive authentication via CLIP / COLP (see M 5.48 authentication by means of CLIP / COLP) that even when an authorized number is prefixed by an unauthorized subscriber, no connection is made because the unauthorized subscriber Actually yes not reachable under the given callback number.
