When procuring information technology, regardless of whether it is hardware or software, the relevant manuals and technical references must be provided in sufficient numbers.

In the scope of supply of IT products, there is increasingly no further documentation available, but in addition to online help only installation aids and introductory texts are included. This limited scope of documentation aids is inadequate, especially if errors occur. It is therefore important to ensure that the required manuals, technical references and error catalogs are also procured. It is not necessary to resort exclusively to the literature offered by the manufacturer.

All manuals for an IT product must be available at all times in the application environment. For example, the manuals for a server operating system must be kept with this server, not in a possibly closed library. In emergency planning, access to this literature must be scheduled (see M 6.3 Creating an emergency manual).
