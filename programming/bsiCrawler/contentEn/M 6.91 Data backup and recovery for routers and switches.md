#M 6.91 Data backup and recovery for routers and switches
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Routers and switches should also be included in the higher-level data protection concept. In particular, securing the configuration files is of great importance.

Backup of file systems is not possible with active network components. Since in the context of a central administration configuration files are often kept on separate servers and also loaded from there, the backup can take place over these servers. The configuration files on these servers should be protected against unauthorized access. This is especially true if passwords are stored in plain text in the configuration files.

If a TFTP server is used to secure the configuration files, this may only be accessible in the administration network. Alternatively, some systems can also back up using PCMCIA memory cartridges.

In order to be prepared for the use of the data backup, recovery exercises must be carried out regularly to restore the backup (see also M 6.41 Exercises for Data Reconstruction).
