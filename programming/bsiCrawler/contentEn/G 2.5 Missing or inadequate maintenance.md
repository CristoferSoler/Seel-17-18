#G 2.5 Missing or inadequate maintenance
The functionality of the technology used must be ensured. By regular maintenance, the functionality of the technology used can be promoted. If maintenance work is not carried out or only insufficiently carried out, it can lead to unforeseeable high damage or consequential damage.



## Examples 
* The batteries of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) have due to lack of maintenance on an insufficient capacity (too low acid content). The UPS can no longer bridge a power failure for a sufficient amount of time.
* Due to a lack of maintenance, the fire extinguishers no longer have sufficient pressure, so that their fire-fighting effect is no longer guaranteed.
* The laser printer will fail due to overheating because a ventilation grille has not been cleaned properly.
* In the server room are many devices with their own heat development. If there are even high summer temperatures and inadequate air conditioning (eg missing or defective air conditioning) of the room, it can occasionally lead to temperature-related Gereausteausf llen due to overheating. Air conditioners that are permanently installed must therefore be regularly maintained and cleaned to ensure a reliable and trouble-free operation.
