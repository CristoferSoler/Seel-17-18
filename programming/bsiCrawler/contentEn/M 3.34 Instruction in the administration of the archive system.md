#M 3.34 Instruction in the administration of the archive system
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, archive administrator, IT manager

In order to be able to administrate an archive system correctly and safely, those responsible and above all the administrators and archive administrators must be familiar with the systems used. For this a training of the responsible archive administrators and administrators is necessary. This should avoid configuration errors and misconduct. The training should cover at least the following topics:

* System architecture and security mechanisms of the archive system used and the underlying operating system,
* Installation and operation of the archive system, handling of the archive media used and marking of the archive media (see also M 2.3 Disk Management),
* Operating conditions (air conditioning, etc.) of the archive system and the archive media,
* Documentation of the administrative activities,
* Logging of system events at the archive system,
* Procedure for updating the data records (see M 2.263 Regular processing of archived data records and M 2.264 Regular editing of encrypted data during archiving),
* Basic terms of encryption and digital signature when cryptographic methods are used
* Approach to the destruction of rejected archive media
* System monitoring and maintenance of the archive system,
* Escalation procedures, e.g. Failure to observe response times, undershoot the remaining storage capacity of the archive media, manipulation or sabotage of the archive system or events of higher authority and unauthorized access to archived data.


The training of administrators and archive administrators must be documented. For system changes administrators and archive administrators should be trained accordingly.
