#G 3.29 Missing or inappropriate segmentation
Local networks can be physically segmented by active network components or logically by a corresponding VLAN configuration. The connected IT systems of a network are distributed to different segments. This improves the load distribution within the network and increases its manageability.

This can lead to the following concrete dangers:

* Loss of availabilityA high number of IT systems within a Layer 2 segment also brings a high network load in the corresponding segment. This can severely impair its availability and even lead to its overloading or failure. Inappropriate segmentation may be present even when systems are separated by layer 2 or 3 active network components that communicate a great deal with one another.
* Insufficient confidentiality protectionTo protect confidential information, only authorized users should have access to it. Broadcast domains are therefore to be limited to what is absolutely necessary. However, if the individual segments have been configured improperly, unauthorized persons can read and evaluate the confidential information that has been transferred.




## Examples 
* TwoIT systems that exchange large amounts of data are separated by a router. If this is a slow router, this can be an inappropriate segmentation because the traffic must pass through a relatively slow router.
