#G 5.5 vandalism
Vandalism destroys or damages foreign property. The effects are very similar to those of an attack, only that vandalism is not deliberately planned and implemented like this, but is usually the expression of spontaneous, blind destructive rage.

Both outsiders (eg demented burglars, out-of-control demonstrators) and internal detainees (eg frustrated or mentally unstable staff) are considered to be the culprits. The actual threat of vandalism is more difficult to assess than that of an attack, as it is generally not based on a goal-oriented motivation. Possible sources of vandalism may include disagreements, personal problems, bullying or a bad working atmosphere.



## Examples 
* Because a customer had to wait too long at a company, he grew annoyed that he was damaging the power cords that ran through a cable duct in the waiting area. As a result, connection problems in the LAN took longer time since the source of the error could not be determined directly.
* Vandalism can also be expressed virtually. The misleading product advertising of a company triggered greater displeasure in certain population groups. As a result, marketing activities of this company were defaced on the Internet by attackers.
