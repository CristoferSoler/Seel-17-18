#M 2.363 Protection against SQL injection
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, application developer

To prevent or at least to hinder the exploitation of SQL injections (see G 5.131 SQL injection), a number of measures have to be taken. These extend over all components of an application, from the application itself over the server to the database management system (DBMS).



## Examples 
* disabling unnecessary services,
* the deletion of unneeded user accounts,
* the import of relevant patches and
* deleting all components that are unnecessary for the function of the server.
