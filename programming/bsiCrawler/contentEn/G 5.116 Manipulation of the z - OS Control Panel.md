#G 5.116 Manipulation of the z / OS Control Panel
z / OS systems can be manipulated through a variety of interfaces, including the Hardware Management Console, MVS Master Console, Enhanced MVS Console Service, Automation Procedures, Remote MVS Console, and Remote Access Access. Some security issues that may be associated with the use of these interfaces are shown below.
