#G 2.75 Lack of capacity of archive data
An incorrect estimate of the data volume during archiving can lead to the use of too small archive media and therefore the archiving process is incomplete or delayed.

When estimating the required volume of data, often only the expected maximum size of the documents to be stored is used as the sole factor. In fact, however, the storage requirements for archive systems can be a multiple of this, since the type of data storage and the change frequency of documents also have a significant influence on this.

When archiving on WORM media (Write Once Read Multiple), for example, the documents are inevitably stored in several versions, ie. after each change, a new document is saved. This can result in a high data volume even for small documents with high change frequency. Old versions of the documents can not be deleted from the archive medium afterwards. In addition to capacity shortages, this can also lead to privacy or confidentiality issues, as data is only marked as delete, but not actually deleted.
