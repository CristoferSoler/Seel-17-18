#M 2.331 Planning of meeting, event and training rooms
Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, head of organization

Responsible for implementation: Head of Organization, Employees

The planned use of meeting, event and training rooms depends not only on the choice of equipment, but also on the required security measures. For this reason, it should first be documented which types of use are intended for which areas and, based on the requirements of the planned application scenarios, the facility should be selected and organizational and technical usage regulations determined.

The location of meeting, event and training rooms should be as much as possible so that strangers do not have to walk around the house unnecessarily, ie as close as possible to the hotel

* entrance
* Sanitary facilities
* canteen


The way to a meeting, event and training room should not be close to, or even through, security-sensitive areas. Likewise, meeting, event and training rooms should be selected and set up to minimize the disruption to normal operations.

The paths to a meeting, event and training room, sanitary facilities and canteen should be clearly marked. This avoids people getting lost in search of it. Likewise, it deprives persons who deliberately go by accident, the basis of argumentation.

It should be used a room booking system, from which also later it is clear who has used the rooms. As a result, alternative options can also be easily identified.
