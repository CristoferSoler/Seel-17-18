#M 1.81 Material security of embedded systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: planner, administrator, developer

Embedded systems should not fail or fail due to dust or contamination. Embedded systems are to be protected against dust and dirt according to their intended use and the intended location. The embedded system can be installed in an enclosing, rugged housing or installed in a sheltered location inside the surrounding system or supporting infrastructure.

If systems can not be sufficiently shrouded due to a necessary air supply, air filters should be provided. These must be suitable in terms of dimensioning and filter performance for the intended types of use.

The precautions for protection against dust and dirt are already to be considered in the planning.
