#M 2.48 Defining authorized fax operator
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: internal service

The authorization to operate the fax machine must be restricted to a selected circle of reliable employees. These employees must be instructed in the correct handling of the device and familiarized with the required safety measures. Every authorized user should be informed about who is allowed to operate the device and who the person responsible for the fax is. In addition, there should be an understandable manual on the fax machine.

Limiting the number of fax operators to the minimum number required for operational use means that the number of people who can read incoming faxes is limited.
