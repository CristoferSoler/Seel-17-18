The key messages on the security strategy should be summarized in an information security guideline to document the security objectives to be followed and the desired level of security for all employees. With the security guideline, the public authority or management clearly acknowledges its responsibility for information security.

When compiling the information security guideline, the following points must be noted:



## Examples 
* The importance of information security and the importance of essential information, business processes and IT for the institution must be presented.
* The security objectives and the relation of the security objectives to the business objectives and tasks of the institution must be explained.
* The core elements of the security strategy should be mentioned.
* The management level must demonstrate to all employees that the security policy is borne and enforced by them. Likewise, there must be lead statements for success review.
* The organizational structure established for the implementation of the security process must be described (see M 2.193 Structure of a suitable organizational structure for information security).
