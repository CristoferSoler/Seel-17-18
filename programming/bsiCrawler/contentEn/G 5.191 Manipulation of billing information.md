#G 5.191 Manipulation of billing information
When using cloud services, a consumption-oriented billing of the services used by the cloud service provider is generally carried out.

The commissioning institution should carry out an audit on the traceability and correctness of this billing information.

In practice, however, it is difficult for the user to prove that the services actually used have been provided. Impacts on service provision resulting from service failures or non-compliance with agreed service level agreements may not be transparent to the user.

The cloud service provider could exploit these conditions in his favor and manipulate the billing information of the commissioning institution. As a result, the integrity of the billing is no longer given. The user is charged for services that were not actually provided.
