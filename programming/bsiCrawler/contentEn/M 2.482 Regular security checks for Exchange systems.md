#M 2.482 Regular security checks for Exchange systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, IT security officer, auditor

The security of a Microsoft Exchange system can only be guaranteed in the long term if it is regularly checked for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

Safety checks should be carried out at regular intervals by different persons. For example, administrators should conduct short checks at relatively short intervals (approximately monthly). It is advisable to set up a test list so that a defined scope of testing is guaranteed. Detected minor problems can usually be corrected immediately by the administrators, larger problems are reported according to the process specifications. At medium-term intervals (several months), security checks should be carried out by other, internal roles (eg information security, IT audit). At longer intervals, examinations by external examiners can be useful.

The following aspects should be taken into account in tests:



## Examples 
* Users with critical authorizationsA synchronization with the authorization concept should take place.
* Change documents for users, role assignments, roles, profiles and authorizations
* In particular, changes to administrative objects should be examined.
