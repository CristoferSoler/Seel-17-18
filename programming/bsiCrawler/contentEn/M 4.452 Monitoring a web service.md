#M 4.452 Monitoring a web service
Responsible for initiation: Responsible for the individual applications, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to understand the security status of a web service, it is necessary to continuously monitor it. The aim of such monitoring is to detect violations of the applicable safety regulations, to detect existing security gaps or to detect misconfigurations that can lead to security gaps.

As part of the security concept for a web service, a monitoring concept must therefore be developed.

As a rule, complex systems such as web services can no longer be monitored by individual administrators, but the control must be carried out automatically by corresponding system components or products. The monitoring of a web service must be adjusted accordingly in case of changes.

In addition, all relevant components must be taken into account in the planning for monitoring a web service. For this reason, the monitoring concept should also include databases and directory services, dependent and used web services as well as the relevant IT systems. This is of particular importance when different services are interconnected via an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).



## Examples 
* Response times of inquiries,
* Number of requests or requests,
* Size of requirements and answers or
* Fills of stores (for example, memory of the JVM, message queues).
