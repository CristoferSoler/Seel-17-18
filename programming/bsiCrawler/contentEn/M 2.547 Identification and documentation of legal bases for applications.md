In order to be able to ensure that business processes or administrative procedures intended to support the applications are operated in conformity with the law, a complete overview is provided for planning (and later also for audit / audit purposes) Required under relevant legal bases (see B .1.16 Requirements Management). This overview is also helpful for the preparation of a procedural directory according to the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).

The legal bases should be summarized in an overview which can be used as an annex to the specifications, the data protection concept and the security concept.

The legal bases applicable to the respective institutions may provide specific information security requirements, for example:

* The need for protection (for example, processing of special types of personal data pursuant to Absatz 3 (9) of the Federal Data Protection Act, sector-specific secrets such as tax or social secrecy codes)
* Guidelines for the content orientation and design of security measures. In particular, when processing personal data are legal requirements such as compliance with the purpose (affects, for example, the requirements for the design and protection of external interfaces and reports) or data minimization and data economy (affects, for example, the requirement for the design of Delays).
* Specifications for specific security measures, such as the use of mirror databases, the Qualified Electronic Signature (QES), pseudonymization or anonymization of the data to be processed or the design of logging
* Specifications for storage or archiving periods
