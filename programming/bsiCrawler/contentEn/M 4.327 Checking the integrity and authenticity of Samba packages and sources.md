#M 4.327 Checking the integrity and authenticity of Samba packages and sources
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

After deciding whether to install Samba from a source code or bin package when planning the use of Samba (see M 2.437 Planning to Use a Samba Server), its authenticity must be checked (see also M 4.177 Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of software packages). The origin of the software to be installed should be documented as well as the process of integrity check of the software.



## Examples 
* Via the web server of the Samba project. The http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/samba-pubkey.asc file contains the public GPG key used by Samba developers to sign source code.
* Via a keyserver.
