#M 2.73 Selection of suitable basic structures for security gateways
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Once a security policy has been set for the security gateway, it must be decided which components the security gateway should be implemented with. For this, a suitable arrangement should be selected.



## Examples 
* Separation of two networks, if the degree of trustworthiness of these networks differs only slightly (eg separation of the Internet from an intranet with low protection requirements).
* Separation of two internal organization networks.
* Private area (protection of the home computer when accessing the Internet).
