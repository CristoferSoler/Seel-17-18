#G 3.118 Inappropriate configuration of cloud services and cloud management systems
The cloud administration includes the settings for the management systems for virtualization and for the cloud. The large number of cloud components to be managed makes changes that must be consistently implemented on all systems, complex and error-prone for cloud management administration. In particular, human error in the cloud administration can cause enormous security problems, because incorrect entries in the management systems lead to inappropriate configurations.



## Examples 
* A virtual machine (as part of a cloud infrastructure) is assigned to a wrong security zone.
* A virtual machine (as part of a cloud infrastructure) is assigned to a wrong tenant.
* In cloud administration, a misconfiguration occurs in the allocation of management servers to virtual storage networks (so-called VSANs). As a result, storage resources are not available to the managed cloud services virtual machines.
