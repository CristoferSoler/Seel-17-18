#G 5.201 Importing (flashing) manipulated software updates / upgrades in embedded systems
In the past, in embedded systems, the firmware was written in ROM (Read Only Memory) blocks and could only be changed by exchanging them. A variety of modern embedded systems have their software in flash memory or EEPROMs and provide the ability to update the firmware after connection to a programmer, via a data interface, or remotely over a network connection.

An attacker could try to import manipulated software updates or upgrades via these paths. For an attack by means of a programming device provided for the embedded system, e.g. For example, if you have a notebook with the appropriate software, most of the internal components are considered as they can physically access the device. An attack on a data network could in principle be done by anyone and would be simplified by missing or weak authentication and software integrity checks. To do this, the attacker must additionally be able to access the data network in order to access the embedded system.

If the manipulation of manipulated software succeeds, the functionality of the system can be modified in the sense of an attacker. This allows the original tasks of the system to be interrupted or manipulated.
