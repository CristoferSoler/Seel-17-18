#M 6.113 Provide adequate resources for emergency management
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: Government / company management, emergency officer

In order to achieve the goals set for emergency management, adequate resources must be provided.

Planning, implementation, operation, maintenance and improvement of emergency management require sufficient financial and human resources and appropriate equipment. These must be provided by the authorities or management to an appropriate extent.

It is recommended that the emergency response officer identify the resources needed, based on the potential risk and the objectives and tasks of emergency preparedness and response management. On the one hand, this serves as the basis for the necessary management decisions on the allocation of resources and, on the other, for the definition of the project plans and the implementation periods.



## Examples 
* Are the financial, technical and human resources adequate for the goals of emergency management?
* Do the emergency officer or the emergency management team have enough time for their emergency management tasks?
