#M 5.174 Securing communication to cloud access
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Cloud service providers provide public interfaces to interact with cloud users. Often this is done via web interfaces. The central access of cloud users to the cloud services provided by the cloud service provider runs via these interfaces. It must use secure interfaces and protocols that allow encrypted communication between cloud service providers and cloud users.



## Examples 
* Does communication to cloud access use HTTPS (instead of HTTP) or is it otherwise secured by TLS / SSL?
* Where no HTTP is used: is there any other appropriate coverage by service-specific protocols?
* For public network communications: Are certificates for HTTPS (or other encryption procedures) sourced from an official certification authority (CA)?
