#G 1.9 Data loss due to strong magnetic fields
Typical data carriers with magnetizable storage media are floppy disks, removable disks, cassettes and tapes. Information is applied via read / write heads. The data carriers magnetized in this way are sensitive to magnetic radiation, so that the proximity to such radiation sources should be avoided.

Depending on the strength of the radiation, this leads to more or less large data losses. This is particularly critical for files that, due to their internal formatting, become completely useless due to minor changes (eg PostScript files, databases).

Examples of sources of magnetic radiation are:

* Electric motors,
* transformers,
* Badge detection devices based on magnetic field.
