#M 5.108 Cryptographic protection of groupware or e-mail
Initiation Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer, IT Leader

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

A groupware system communicates with groupware clients, browsers, telephony and communication applications and other groupware systems. There is also a data exchange between the groupware system components. Communication takes place via the local network and / or external networks. In all cases, data is transmitted, which must be protected. This is not just the data used to authenticate users (such as username and password), but also business-related information. It must therefore be decided with which protective mechanisms the communication is secured.

Encryption and digital signatures serve to protect the integrity and confidentiality as well as the non-repudiation of electronically transmitted messages.

So that electronic communication such as e-mail can not be changed or read along the way, it must be cryptographically secured. Confidentiality can be achieved through encryption and the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of digital signatures.

In general, the cryptographic protection of groupware or e-mail is possible on three levels:



## Examples 
* With a corresponding protection requirement for confidentiality and integrity: Is there a concept for the cryptographic protection of e-mails?
