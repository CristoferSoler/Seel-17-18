#G 5.141 Data theft via mobile data carriers
Many IT systems have interfaces for the use of exchangeable data memories, such as. Additional memory cards or USB storage media. In the case of an unattended IT system with the corresponding hardware and software, there is a risk that large amounts of data can be copied without authorization via these data memories. This process is usually completed after a short time and not even directly recognizable.

Of course, these interfaces can also be used in the opposite way in order to infiltrate malicious programs on an IT system or in a network.

Mobile data carriers can also be integrated in devices with other recording functions, eg. in mobile phones, MP3 players or digital cameras. Here, too, sensitive information may be taken without authorization (see G 5.126 Unauthorized photo and film recordings with mobile devices).
