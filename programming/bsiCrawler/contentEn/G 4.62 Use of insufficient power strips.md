#G 4.62 Use of insufficient power strips
Often, the number of fixed sockets for the amount of devices to be operated is not sufficient. To compensate for this deficiency, then typically socket strips are used. Such power strips provide, if they are of insufficient quality, due

* defective contacting,
* too weak contact springs,
* lack of strain relief,
* too small a cable cross section,
* from overload


a dangerous source of ignition and thus a great fire hazard.

If, in addition, several smaller socket strips are connected in series to provide sufficient slots for all devices, the risk of too small line cross-section and overload continues to increase.

If socket strips are lying in the floor of workplaces, they are often exposed to mechanical stresses due to footsteps, vacuuming etc. As a result, missing strain relief and weak contacts can quickly lead to contact resistance, overheating and ultimately to fire. In addition, such exposed sockets are dangerous fangs.
