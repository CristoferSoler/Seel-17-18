#M 4.34 Use of Encryption, Checksums or Digital Signatures
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: users

If confidential information or information with a high integrity claim is transmitted and there is some possibility that such data may be accessed by unauthorized persons, manipulated by it or altered by technical errors, a cryptographic process should be used for protection data for transport or transmission.



## Examples 
* Is the encryption program protected against unauthorized access?
* Is an encryption algorithm used to transmit confidential information, and does this algorithm conform to the state of the art?
* Is a procedure for protection against accidental or consequential changes used for the transmission of information with a high integrity claim and does this procedure comply with the current state of the art?
* Is there a base on which the encryption, checksum and digital signature procedures are trusted?
