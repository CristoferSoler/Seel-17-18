#G 5.113 MAC spoofing
The MAC address (media access control) of a device is an address specified by the manufacturer with which devices are addressed on OSI layer 2.

Various security mechanisms at the network level (for example, port security for switches) are based on the fact that a connection may only be set up by one device with a specific MAC address.

Using appropriate programs, an attacker can change the MAC address of his device and send Ethernet frames with a foreign identifier into the network segment. In this way, security mechanisms based solely on the use of a MAC address can be bypassed. The attacker must, however, be in the same network segment or even have access to the same switch port as the device, as he pretends to be using MAC spoofing.

A threat of MAC spoofing exists even with wireless networks (WLAN), where the access point has been configured for access control.
