#G 3.56 Incorrect integration of the IIS in the system environment
TheIIS is used worldwide in a variety of environments. The deployment environment is understood to mean the network topology (arrangement of further hardware and software components, network components) in which the IIS is operated. As an essential aspect, the communication needs of the IIS with other systems have to be considered.

Securing a public server that can be reached from the Internet is usually associated with a much greater effort compared to a server installed on the intranet. Of crucial importance is the safe use of suitable separation devices.

An insufficiently planned network structure, eg. Without a demilitarized zone (DMZ) or a badly configured firewall, can be exploited for an attack from the Internet or intranet.

Another risk arises from insufficiently sized system resources (firewall, network connection). If these systems do not meet the requirements for the availability and performance of the actual Web server, there is a risk of a single-point-of-failure (SPOF).
