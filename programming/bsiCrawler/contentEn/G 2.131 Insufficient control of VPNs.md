#G 2.131 Insufficient control of VPNs
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a potential target of attacks, whether in order to be able to use it unauthorizedly, in order to cease the communication in progress or to disturb its availability (DoS attacks) ). Such attacks can cause sensitive disruption to both the VPN-connected infrastructure and all connected applications.

If a VPN and its components are not adequately controlled, it is difficult to detect attacks at all and in a timely manner. The longer a potential attacker can unnoticeably access a VPN, the greater the danger to the company or the authorities that, for example, confidential data will be read. To counteract such dangers, logging functions are usually used. Often, however, it is not taken into consideration that no evaluation of safety will take effect without evaluation of the log data.



## Examples 
* An attacker circumvents the authentication of a corporate VPN by means of a brute force attack. The attack is logged by the VPN gateway. Since the responsible administrator checks the logs only sporadically because of overloading, the attack is not detected promptly. The attacker is therefore able to access the company's internal network as well as the affiliated networks of suppliers for a longer period of time.
