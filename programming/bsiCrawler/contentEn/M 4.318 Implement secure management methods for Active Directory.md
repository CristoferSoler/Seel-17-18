#M 4.318 Implement secure management methods for Active Directory
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

For the administration of a domain responsibilities and tasks are divided into further subgroups. Because the user accounts are located in the service administrators management groups (responsible for performing the tasks required to deploy the directory service) and data administrators (responsible for managing the content stored in Active Directory or through Active Directory protected) have particularly far-reaching access rights, appropriate precautions must be taken to protect them:



## Examples 
* Disable inheritance of superordinate object permissions
* Access permissions to the organizational unit to be set up (including child objects) Administrators: Full ControlOrganization Admins: Full Control Domain Administrators: Full Control
* Pre  Windows 2000-compliant access permissions for user objects, if applicable List contentsAll properties Read permissions
