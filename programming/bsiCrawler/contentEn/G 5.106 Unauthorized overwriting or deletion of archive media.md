#G 5.106 Unauthorized overwriting or deletion of archive media
On archival media, important data should be stored long-term and unaltered. Therefore, these may not be overwritten, deleted or otherwise altered without justification. Unauthorized deletion is possible if user rights have been wrongly assigned, ie. if

* Users have the right to delete, but they can not make any sensible decisions based on the information available to them, whether or not they may be deleted, or
* due to erroneous administration users may have the authority to delete.


Here are rewritable media and WORM media to distinguish:

* For rewritable media, physical erasure or overwriting of data sets is generally possible.
* With WORM media, a physical deletion or overwriting is basically not possible. However, archiving systems usually offer the option of logically marking records as deleted. These data sets will no longer be copied when copying to a new data carrier. They are therefore only removed from the database at the moment of copying to the new data carrier.


In both cases, misuse of the media may lead to a loss of integrity of the stored information and data (see also G 5.85 Integrity loss of valuable information).
