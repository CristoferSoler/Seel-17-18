#G 2.95 Missing concept for connecting other systems to Exchange
The information networks present in institutions are mostly heterogeneous, both in terms of the operating systems used and in terms of the applications. These often reflect the history of the growth and convergence of the organizational structure in the company or in the authorities.

Microsoft Exchange systems are closely interlinked with the Microsoft Windows operating system and harmonize only through so-called connectors with third-party systems. Because not all versions of Microsoft Exchange support all connectors in Microsoft Exchange, it is also worth considering the continuation of existing connectors as part of a migration (see G 2.91 Exchange Migration Planning Incorrectly).

From a security point of view, Microsoft Windows Server security settings that apply to the Microsoft Exchange system can not apply outside of the homogenous Microsoft environment.

Conversely, of course, the established security policies of the third-party systems may not be valid for the Microsoft Exchange system. In the separate administration of different subsystems inconsistencies can always occur.

An improper connection of third-party systems can also result in the loss of data or a blockage of the system.
