#G 4.81 Extended rights through program dialogs on terminal servers
Secure configurations of terminal servers usually provide restrictive access. For this purpose, only certain applications that are listed in a whitelist should be offered to the user and started. Access to the entire desktop, which allows a variety of launch and interaction options to and from applications, is usually prevented. Frequently, however, other applications can be started via program dialogs in shared applications, and both read and write authorizations can be extended.



## Examples 
* file: // Allows access to the local file system
* tftp: // Trivial File Transfer Protocol, allowing file access to embedded systems such as routers, printers, etc.
* mailto: // Starts the e-mail program registered as default in the system
* telnet: // Starts a Telnet application
* nfs: // Network File System Protocol, access to NFS file servers
* skype: //, callto: // Link to voice-over-IP applications
