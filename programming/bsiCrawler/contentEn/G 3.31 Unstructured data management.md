#G 3.31 Unstructured data management
Inadequate specifications and / or lack of training of the employees can lead to an inconvenient storage of the data on the used data carriers. This can lead to various problems like:

* Space wastage due to multiple storage of files,
* premature deletion or deletion of data because no one knows what is stored in which files,
* unauthorized access if files are located in directories or on data carriers made available to third parties, or
* non-consistent versions in different records and IT systems.
