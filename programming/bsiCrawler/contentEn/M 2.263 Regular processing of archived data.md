#M 2.263 Regular processing of archived data
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Archive administrator, IT manager

For proper archiving, it must be ensured over the entire archiving period that:

* the data format used corresponds to the state of the art and can be processed by the applications used at present and in the future,
* the stored data are also readable in the future and can be reproduced while preserving the semantics and the detection power,
* the used file system can be processed on the storage medium by all involved components,
* the storage media can be read at any time physically,
* the cryptographic encryption and digital signature used correspond to the state of the art and
* for all components of the storage unit (storage media, drives, jukeboxes and control software) replacement and maintenance options exist.


If it is foreseeable that one of the required properties will no longer be available in the near future, the affected systems must be replaced. It should be remembered that under certain circumstances a significant amount of archived data needs to be copied to new media.

For the processing of encrypted or signed documents, reference is made to the M 2.264 regular processing of encrypted data during archiving and M .2.265 Appropriate use of digital signatures during archiving.
