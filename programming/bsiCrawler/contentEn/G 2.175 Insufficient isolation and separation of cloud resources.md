#G 2.175 Insufficient isolation and separation of cloud resources
Providing cloud services to different cloud users (clients) from a common and distributed cloud infrastructure is an essential feature of cloud computing. The shared cloud infrastructure creates the threat that one cloud tenant can unauthorized access, manipulate, or delete another's information. This can result in damage to both cloud users and cloud service providers.

The pooling of resources can create a variety of threats, as the following examples show:

* Vulnerabilities within a virtualization server: When a client of a virtual machine that has full access to it (for example, IaaS), gets unauthorized access to a foreign virtual machine.
* Remote network attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, that attempt to intercept network traffic from a foreign virtual machine without permission.
* Dangers due to access to third-party storage resources, such as B. Promoting foreign identities with the aim of gaining access to the data of another client.
* Dangers due to injection attacks: At SaaS, customer data is usually stored in a common database. The distinction between the customers is then made using a so-called tenant ID. If the split application is programmed insecurely, then a customer could. For example, you may access the data of another customer through an SQL injection without permission.
