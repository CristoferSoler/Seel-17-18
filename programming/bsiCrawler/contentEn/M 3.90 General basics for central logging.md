Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Most IT systems within an information network can be configured to generate log data about various events, such as file accesses. These contain important information that can help to identify and locate hardware and software problems as well as resource bottlenecks. Furthermore, log data is also used to detect security issues and attacks. In order to obtain an overall overview of an information network, a central logging server can be used, which brings together the different log data, analyzes it and monitors it.
