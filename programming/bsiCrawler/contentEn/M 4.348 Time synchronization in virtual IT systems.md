#M 4.348 Time synchronization in virtual IT systems
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Many applications need a correct system time to work properly. This already begins with file servers with the fact that the files stored on it are provided with a time stamp. Other systems use the system time in different ways. Certain authentication systems, such as Kerberos or token-based systems, require a correct system time to work trouble-free. Monitoring systems such as mrtg usually use the system time as an index for their records stored in a database.

For these reasons, care must be taken to ensure that the system time of a virtual IT system also progresses correctly. For virtualization products that are based on complete server virtualization, this is often not guaranteed.



## Examples 
* Has the impact of virtualization on system time been sufficiently considered when virtualizing a particular IT system or application?
* Have the applications of the virtual IT systems been checked for problems with irregular system time?
* Has a general concept been developed how to ensure a sufficient synchronicity of the system time in the virtual IT systems?
