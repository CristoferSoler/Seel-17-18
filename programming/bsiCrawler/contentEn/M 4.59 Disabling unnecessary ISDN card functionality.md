#M 4.59 Disabling unnecessary ISDN card functionality
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Modern ISDN cards as well as their communication software or the operating system loaded into the card RAM have numerous performance features that exceed the pure ISDN functionality. Such comfort functionalities, which can sometimes be addressed even when the IT system is switched off, are:

* the receipt and sending of faxes,
* Functions of a digital answering machine,
* listening to received digital answering machine records,
* Telephoning over a microphone or receiver included with the card.


As far as possible, non-essential card functionality should be disabled, preferably by removing the respective software module. If card functionality can only be configured by means of parameters, the correct setting of the parameters must be checked regularly.
