#M 2.293 Maintenance of zSeries systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The maintenance concept includes the maintenance of the zSeries hardware, the z / OS operating system, the various program products and the maintenance of the zSeries microcode (firmware). Maintenance concerns the complete lifecycle of a product, from the new installation over the permanent care up to the dismantling.



## Examples 
* Commissioning of a new system
* Changes as function extension or retrofitting of functions
* Fixing of reported errors by so-called PTFs (Program Temporary Fixes)
* Incorporating PTFs as a preventive measure (particularly important here are PTFs against reported safety gaps) based on manufacturer information
* Dismantling systems
