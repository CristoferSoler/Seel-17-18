#M 2.481 Planning to use Exchange for Outlook Anywhere
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

Outlook Anywhere allows users to access Exchange over the Internet. It is a server-side deployment service, not client software. Because traffic on the Internet is more vulnerable to attack than traffic on an intranet, it is recommended that you choose a security strategy that includes as many security options as possible.



## Examples 
* For the safe use of Outlook Anywhere, the statements on the Microsoft Technet web pages under Understanding Security for Outlook Anywhere: Exchange 2010 Help should be considered. The configuration settings are documented under Managing Outlook Anywhere: Exchange 2010 Help. The focus here is on activation, deactivation, authentication, SSL encryption, and certificate management.
