#G 3.95 Incorrect configuration of the operating system for a Samba server
Incorrect configuration of the operating system for a Samba server can interfere with the secure and error-free operation of the server or make the effects of malfunction worse. Common errors in the configuration of the operating system are:

* Use of an unmatched file system, or mismatched file system options with Samba. If the third-extended file system (ext3) file system of a Samba file share is included without the acl option, this can lead to a loss of information. For example, moving file folders from a Windows system to a Samba file share may result in the loss of any Access Control List (ACL) entries that can not be mapped using Unix's standard file system permissions.
* Misconfiguration of the local packet filter. The Samba service listens on different TCP and UDP ports to establish network connections with the clients. If access to these ports from outside is regulated with a packet filter, the Samba service may not be reachable if the packet filter is configured incorrectly.
