#G 4.37 Lack of reliability of groupware
Groupware services replace the traditional approach in many places, so e-mail replaces traditional communication by mail, calendars or address books are maintained online. However, it is often ignored that these services are not sufficiently reliable without additional security measures. This concerns the confidentiality as well as the integrity and availability of these services and the information processed with them.



## Examples 
* Many e-mail programs offer options such as confirm delivery or confirm receipt. Corresponding feedback should not be overestimated. On the one hand, the delivery confirmations are often not triggered by the arrival of an e-mail at the workstation of the recipient, but by the arrival at a mail server. Whether the mail server has successfully forwarded the e-mail to the addressee is then no longer communicated. On the other hand, there is often no delivery confirmation, even though the e-mail was transmitted correctly if this option is not supported by the recipient site.
