#M 4.332 Secure configuration of access control for a Samba server
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Samba leaves access control in the file system to the kernel of the operating system. For this reason, each user on the Samba server must have both a Windows and a Unix user account. That is, each domain user must exist with all group memberships in the Unix operating system.

The complexity of access control when using Samba has two reasons. First of all, Samba can not map the Windows rights model directly to Unix, and secondly, Samba evaluates the following layers when accessing the file system:

* Unix file permissions
* Samba Share Definitions
* Samba Share Access Control Lists (ACLs)




## Examples 
* Read-Only: The contents of this file can only be read but not written. The file can not be deleted. Since under DOS the DOS attributes can be set free by every user, this attribute does not enforce effective write protection. The write protection bit is only to be understood as a help against incorrect operation.
* System (System): This file is intended for specific operating systems purposes.
* Hidden: This file is not displayed to the user (for example, when using Windows Explorer or the command dir on the command line).
* Archive: The archive bit is set with each write access. Backup programs are free to reset this bit. This allows an incremental backup to be made.
