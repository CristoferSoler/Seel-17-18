#G 2.139 Poor consideration of mobile devices in patch and change management
The growing mobility of devices is one of the unique challenges for patch and change management. Mobile systems are not always involved in the automated distribution of patches and changes due to their changing location and their connection to existing networks due to wireless technologies.

In addition, mobile terminals typically do not provide the same bandwidth and stability for data transmission as stationary systems in a LAN. The creation of backup copies and recovery points takes longer in comparison and works less reliable.

If mobile systems are not considered separately when planning patches and changes, the distribution can only be incomplete, takes more time than planned and always poses a security risk.



## Examples 
* The mobile phones procured by a company can only be updated via a connection to a computer. To do this, the users must hand over the mobile devices to the IT department of the company. After a serious flaw in the Bluetooth implementation was discovered and a security patch became public, attackers were able to extract important information from some devices because the employees had not updated their devices in a timely manner.
