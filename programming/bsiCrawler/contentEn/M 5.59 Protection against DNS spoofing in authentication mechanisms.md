#M 5.59 Protection against DNS spoofing in authentication mechanisms
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Danger from DNS spoofing during authentication exists if this is carried out using a computer name. This should be made more difficult by one of the following configurations (even in combination):

1.IP addresses, no hostnames should be used.

2. If hostnames are used, all names should be resolved locally via entries in the / etc / hosts file.

3. If hostnames are used and can not be resolved locally, all names should be resolved directly from a DNS server that is the primary or secondary DNS server for these names That means, he did not store them in a temporary cache, but permanently.

Punkt 1 offers the highest, Punkt 3 the lowest security. The aim of the above configurations is to protect the association between IP addresses and computer names from tampering. Under no circumstances should a host-based authentication be granted via a host name, if the name resolution can not be executed directly, ie if a cache is interposed.
