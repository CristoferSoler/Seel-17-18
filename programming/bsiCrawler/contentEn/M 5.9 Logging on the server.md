#M 5.9 Logging on the server
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The logging possible on the network server must be activated to a reasonable extent. At regular intervals, the network administrator must check the network server's log files. All security-related events should be logged. The following events are of particular interest:

* incorrect password entry for a user ID up to the blocking of the user ID when the failed test limit is reached,
* Attempts of unauthorized access,
* Power failure,
* Data on network utilization and overload.


How many events are logged depends, among other things, on the protection requirements of the respective IT systems. The higher their protection requirements, the more should be logged.

Since the log files can become very extensive over time, the evaluation intervals should be selected so short that a meaningful evaluation is possible. To allow a meaningful evaluation, each log entry should contain user ID or process number, identification of the terminal, date and time.

It is necessary to check which legal or contractual retention periods for log files must be observed. In order to ensure the traceability of actions, a minimum storage period may be required, for data protection reasons there may also be a duty to delete (see also M 2.110 Data protection aspects during logging).
