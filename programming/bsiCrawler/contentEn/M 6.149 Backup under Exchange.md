#M 6.149 Backup under Exchange
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

A data backup concept has to be created for Exchange that should be integrated into the existing data protection concept of the institution (see also module B 1.4 Data backup concept). Not only Exchange servers but also the Outlook clients should be considered.



## Examples 
* The backup and restore capabilities of Microsoft Exchange 2010 are based on the volume shadow copies of the Microsoft Windows Server architecture. An online backup of the databases is performed (see Exchange Backup and Recovery Architecture).
* The high-availability features of Microsoft Exchange 2010 should be considered when backing up. An overview is provided by Backup and Restore Concepts.
* The backup of an Outlook .PST file can be done with the Microsoft Add-In: Personal Folders Backup. This is described in Managing PST files in Microsoft Outlook.
