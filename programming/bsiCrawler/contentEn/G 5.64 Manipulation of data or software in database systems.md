#G 5.64 Manipulation of data or software in database systems
Targeted manipulation of data makes it inadvertently corrupted or rendered useless. The corresponding consequences are described in G4.28 Loss of database data and G4.430 Loss of database integrity / consistency.

If the files of a database or of the standard database software are deleted or modified deliberately, this leads to the deliberate destruction of the entire database system (see G4.26 Failure of a database).

In principle, it can not be prevented that users with the appropriate access and access permissions can perform targeted data manipulation or destroy a database. If it is also possible to bypass the access and access authorizations (eg due to incorrect administration of the DBMS), unauthorized users can gain access to the database and manipulate it there.
