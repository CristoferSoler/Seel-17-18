#G 5.29 Unauthorized copying of the data carrier
If data carriers are exchanged or transported, this may mean that the information to be transmitted from a secure environment is transmitted to the recipient via an insecure transport route into an insecure environment. In such cases, unauthorized persons can obtain this information more easily by copying it than was the case in the original environment.

Due to the high concentration of valuable information on data carriers of electronic archives (eg personal data or company-confidential data), these represent a particular target for theft or copy by unauthorized persons.



## Examples 
* Confidential development results are to be transported from the X-City development laboratory to Y-City for production. If the corresponding data carriers are sent unchecked by post, it can not be ruled out that they will be illegally copied and, if necessary, sold to the competition without notice being given of the information being displayed.
