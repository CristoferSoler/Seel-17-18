#G 3.80 Error synchronizing databases
In order to keep the data of a database in different locations or on mobile terminals, often databases or extracts thereof are mirrored. To synchronize these data, database synchronization is required.

Synchronization can lead to conflicts and loss of data if two users have changed or deleted the same record in mirrored databases. The rules configured in the system often do not help here, which data is overwritten under which conditions, as the data changes usually have to be considered in terms of content. Even if these rules apply to all synchronizations, these rules are not always known to all users and may lead to the wrong result.

Synchronizations between databases in different locations are normally performed automatically. Conflicts are often only recognized when a database administrator opens the database or analyzes the log files. The database administrator often can not decide how to resolve the conflict due to lack of authority and knowledge of the data content. This is also true if the synchronization was initiated manually, but the synchronization programs do not inform the user about conflicts that occur.

Mobile devices are usually synchronized manually. Some databases offer the possibility to inform users about conflicts. Nevertheless, a user can not always decide on the synchronization of the data, if he is not aware of all circumstances of the data changes.
