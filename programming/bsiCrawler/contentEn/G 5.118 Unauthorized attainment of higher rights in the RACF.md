#G 5.118 Unauthorized attainment of higher rights in the RACF
If a user succeeds in increasing his privileges in the z / OS RACF security system, he may be able to access files and manipulate the system without authorization.



## Examples 
* Expertise is not widely used in the z / OS environment. As a result, expert z / OS consultants spent a long time in a company accumulating rights. An administrator noticed this only coincidentally when the authorization concept of the company was completely revised.
