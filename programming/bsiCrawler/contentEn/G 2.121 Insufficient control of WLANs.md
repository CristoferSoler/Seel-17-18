#G 2.121 Insufficient control of WLANs
A WLAN is a potential target of attacks, whether in order to be able to use it unauthorized or to disturb its availability (DoS attacks). These could entail a compromise of the infrastructure connected to the WLAN. If there is no adequate control of the WLAN, attacks are usually not recognized at all or not promptly.



## Examples 
* If too much information is logged or stored too long, there is a risk that the databases of the Intrusion Detection System will overflow.
* If too little or the wrong data is recorded during logging, an attack may not be detected and no meaningful post-mortem analysis can be performed.
