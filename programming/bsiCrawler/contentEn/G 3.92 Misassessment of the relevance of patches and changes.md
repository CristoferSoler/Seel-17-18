#G 3.92 Misassessment of the relevance of patches and changes
If the importance of patches for secure IT operation is misjudged, this can lead to incorrect prioritization. If the updates are prioritized incorrectly, it may happen that unimportant patches are installed first. Important patches, on the other hand, will then be installed too late and security gaps will remain unobstructed for a long time.

Patch and change management is often supported by software-based tools. These tools, too, can contain software errors, making inadequate or incorrect information about a change. Therefore, the information that such a tool makes about a change must always be checked and tested for plausibility.



## Examples 
* When it comes to patch and change management, a colleague by mistake protects the relevance and therefore the priority of a security patch as very high and causes an emergency patch to be applied to all affected systems. The shortened testing phases overlook a bug in this patch that opens a fatal security vulnerability elsewhere.
