#G 4.55 Data loss when resetting the password from Windows Server 2003 and XP
Windows operating systems as of Server 2003 and Windows XP protect the private keys of local user accounts from being used by administrators. Local user account means that the username and password of the account can only exist and be used on the respective computer. In earlier versions of Windows, an administrator could reset the password of a local user account, and then use and export the user's private keys. As of Windows Server 2003 / XP, the crypto-API deletes all private keys stored for such a user account as soon as the password is reset by an administrator. This behavior makes it possible to hide highly confidential information from even administrators. However, after being reset by an administrator, all private keys are lost if no backup has been created. Encrypted data in emails and files will no longer be available.

This behavior can also cause the recovery agent's private key for the Encrypting File System (EFS) to be lost if the recovery agent has been assigned to a local user account. In this case, a recovery agent is configured. However, since access to the user account keys is not possible, this scenario equals a nonexistent recovery agent. The data of users who can no longer use their own key would be lost in this case.
