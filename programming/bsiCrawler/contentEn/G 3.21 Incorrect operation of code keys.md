#G 3.21 Incorrect operation of code keys
Experience has shown that errors in the operation of mechanical code keys often lead to the fact that the cabinet can not be opened properly. The incorrect operations occur during input and especially frequently when the code is changed. In order to make the stored data carriers or information technology devices accessible again, a specialized key service must then be commissioned so that in addition to the damage resulting from the lack of availability of the data carriers or devices , can also incur significant repair costs. In the worst case, a new protective cabinet must be procured.
