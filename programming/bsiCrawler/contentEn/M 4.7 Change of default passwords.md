#M 4.7 Change of default passwords
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, PBX manager, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

Many IT systems, PBXs, and network switches (such as ISDN routers, voice-data multiplexers, and so on) have factory default passwords after delivery by the manufacturer. Passwords preset by manufacturers or administrators must be changed immediately after installation, at the latest when hardware or software are put into operation for the first time. In this case, the relevant rules for passwords must be observed (see M 2.11 Control of Password Usage).

Attention: For some PBXs, any changes made to the configuration are only made in the RAM. This also applies to password changes. Therefore, after such an operation always make a backup and create a new backup copy. If this is not the case, the default password is valid again after a restart of the system. Furthermore, it should be checked, if after setting up a new password the standard password has actually lost its validity and can not be used for the system access.
