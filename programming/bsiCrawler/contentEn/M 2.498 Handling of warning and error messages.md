#M 2.498 Handling of warning and error messages
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

For the treatment of warning and error messages, structured and comprehensible processes must be introduced and the implemented measures documented.

These processes should describe who is responsible for processing the message (roles or persons) and how the information about the message is transmitted (eg e-mail, SMS, generation of a message) trouble tickets).

If the institution already has an alerting concept, then the network management warning and error messages are to be embedded in it.

The following lists possible events, causes and reactions for warning and error messages.



## Examples 
* The threshold values ??defined in the network concept and stored in the network management system are exceeded or fallen short of.
* Services offered are not provided with the required goods.
* There are network traffic anomalies detected by the network management system.
