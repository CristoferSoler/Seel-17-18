#G 3.99 Incorrect network connections of a virtualization server


## Examples 
* by direct assignment of virtual to physical networks. The network card of a virtual IT system is assigned directly to a physical interface of the virtualization server.
* by indirect assignment. The (virtual) network cards of the virtual IT systems are connected to a virtual switch. This is simulated by the virtualization server in software. The virtual switch in turn can be connected to the physical network by means of a physical network card. Since a virtual switch does not necessarily have to have a physical network transition, in this way a network can be realized in which the virtual IT systems connected to it have no external connection. Such a configuration can be used, for example, for test systems which do not require any external connections.
