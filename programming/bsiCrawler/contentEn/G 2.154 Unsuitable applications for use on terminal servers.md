#G 2.154 Unsuitable applications for use on terminal servers
Applications that can not be installed and run on a terminal server are becoming increasingly scarce. Nevertheless, it may happen that individual applications in a complex software environment can not be installed on terminal servers. If the applications have not been tested in advance for a multi-user environment, applications may fail, become unstable, or incur unpredictable inconsistencies in the database.

Transferring multimedia content often presents a particular challenge to a terminal server environment. When audio and video data, or even real-time 3D graphics (eg in the CAD area) are transmitted, it will increase to the terminals transferring data stream strongly. If multimedia content is to be transmitted, users may be severely impaired in their work with the IT system due to poor planning and design of existing resources. This can cause all sessions on the congested terminal server to freeze or break data connections. Even if such elaborate applications were not provided, but access to them (eg via a browser plug-in) is still possible due to a misconfiguration, these problems can occur.
