#G 5.174 Injection attacks
In an Injection attack, an attacker attempts to inject and execute commands in a Web application or Web service. The attack is usually directed against server-side interpreters or a parser.

For example, if inbound data is insufficiently validated, input (for example, form data, cookies, SOAP messages, or HTTP headers) may be selected to be used by the web application and the interpreters or parsers used (for example, SQL database, XML Processors, LDAP directory service) can be interpreted as a command. In this way, commands for reading out or manipulating data can be transmitted without authorization.

If any system commands can be executed by injection, an attacker can use the web application or the web service as a replacement for a system shell. The remote system commands are usually executed in the security context and thus with the privileges of the web application / the web service or the interpreter or parser used.

Injection attacks are classified into attack types based on the attacked interpreter / parser. The following examples illustrate this classification:

* SQL injection (see also G 5.131 SQL injection)
* LDAP Injection
* Mail command injection
* OS command injection
* SSI Injection
* XPath Injection
* Code Injection
