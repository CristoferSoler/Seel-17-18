Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: user, administrator

Backup volumes are subject to special retention requirements:

* Access to these media may only be granted to authorized persons, so that theft can be ruled out.
* A sufficiently fast access must be ensured if necessary.
* The repository must also ensure the climatic conditions for longer term storage of data media.
* In the event of a disaster, backup volumes must be kept physically separate from the computer, if possible in a different fire compartment.


Also note the requirements of M 2.3 Disk Management.
