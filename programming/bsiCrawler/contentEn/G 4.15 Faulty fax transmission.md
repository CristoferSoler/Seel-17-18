#G 4.15 Faulty fax transmission
When sending a fax, faults may occur on the transmission path or on the devices involved. This may cause faxes to arrive incomplete, unreadable or not at the recipient. Decisions that depend on this information can be flawed and cause harm.

Furthermore, there is a risk that a fax will be transmitted to a wrong recipient. The cause may be a malfunction in the public telecommunications network. It is also conceivable that in conventional fax machines numbers dialed incorrectly or speed dial keys are programmed incorrectly. When using fax servers, a recipient's phone number may be entered incorrectly or mis-stored in the address book. As a result, confidential information may be disclosed to unauthorized persons. The possible damage depends on the confidentiality of the information. In addition, the sender will remain in the belief that the fax was properly transmitted to the desired addressee. Time delays occurring as a result can lead to damage.
