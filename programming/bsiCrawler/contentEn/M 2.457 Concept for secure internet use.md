#M 2.457 Concept for secure internet use
Responsible for initiation: Public authorities / management, IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

Almost every institution today uses the Internet. In addition to the many advantages of the Internet, there are constantly new reports about risks that users are exposed to when using the Internet. In order to minimize this, every new variant of Internet use should be carefully planned and all IT components and their networking should be securely installed and configured.

In a concept for the secure use of the Internet, it must first be clarified who should be allowed to use which Internet services, which regulations should be observed and how the internal IT systems should be protected. The concept must be embedded in the general security strategy of the respective institution and must therefore be coordinated with information security management.
