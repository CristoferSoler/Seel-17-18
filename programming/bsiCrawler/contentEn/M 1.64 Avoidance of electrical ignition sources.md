#M 1.64 Avoidance of electrical ignition sources
Responsible for initiation: fire protection officer, head of building services

Responsible for implementation: building services, employees

The major part of structural fire protection measures is aimed at confining developing hands, as well as at facilitating the escape of persons and the use of rescue forces. These measures usually have little influence on the formation of fires.

Here, the human being in his daily work environment must pay particular attention and precautions. In addition to the well-known and obvious sources of fire such as ashtrays, the tip in the trash or Christmas candlestick, attention must also be paid to the less obvious sources of electrical ignition.



## Examples 
* Only high-quality socket strips should be used, which have been checked by a qualified electrician and found to be safe.
* It should be used single enough large power strip instead of several smaller.
* Socket strips must never be plugged one behind the other.
* Socket strips may under no circumstances be overloaded. In general, the limit is 3500 watts. Here, the nameplate must be observed.
* Socket strips should not be located in the foot area at the workplace or in traffic areas.
