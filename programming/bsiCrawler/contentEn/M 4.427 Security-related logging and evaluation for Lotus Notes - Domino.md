#M 4.427 Security-related logging and evaluation for Lotus Notes / Domino
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Data Protection Officer, Administrator, IT Security Officer, Staff Council / Works Council

To map the protection needs of the applications and services running on the Lotus Notes / Domino platform, it is necessary to log and periodically or event-driven evaluate security-related events. This can be done for the Lotus Notes / Domino environment via the functions of administration or security administration.

Since logs of security-relevant data or their evaluations can contain personal data as well as data with relevance to employee behavior and employee productivity, the relevant legislation must be taken into account here. It is necessary for the Data Protection Officer and the Staff Council / Works Council both in the preparation of the Lotus Notes / Domino logging and evaluation concept described in M 2.207 Security Concept for Lotus Notes / Domino as well as in the operational measures to implement this To incorporate the concept.

If the private use of services of the Lotus Notes / Domino environment (eg BE-Mail, Internet access of the employees) is explicitly permitted or tolerated, the main issue is the limitations and the necessary agreements between the institution and employees Reference to logging and evaluation.

The use of so-called SIEM tools (Security Information Event Management) or Log Analyzer is possible for the evaluation of log data. However, these also require an appropriate configuration of the logging in the connected platforms.
