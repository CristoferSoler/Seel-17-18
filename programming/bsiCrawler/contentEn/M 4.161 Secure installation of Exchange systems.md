#M 4.161 Secure installation of Exchange systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Safe installation of all components is always a prerequisite for the smooth and safe operation of the system. As with any complex client-server system, the installation of Exchange servers and Outlook clients must be planned and tested. The installation should be based on the mission planning of Exchange and Outlook and the defined security policy (see M 2.247 Planning the Use of Exchange and Outlook). Since Exchange systems integrate very strongly into the Windows environment, especially in the Active Directory, the specific security guidelines must be taken into account.

The systems on which Exchange / Outlook should be installed must be suitably secured. The installation can not be considered complete until the Exchange / Outlook systems have been brought to a safe state. This ensures that only authorized administrators can access the Exchange system in the subsequent configuration phase.

When installing an Exchange system, the aspects described in M 4.356 Secure Installation of Groupware Systems must also be taken into account.



## Examples 
* Have all components required to operate the Exchange system been securely installed?
* Have all relevant Microsoft hints for installing Microsoft Exchange been implemented?
