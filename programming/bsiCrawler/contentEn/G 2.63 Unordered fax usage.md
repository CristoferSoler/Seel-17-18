#G 2.63 Unordered fax usage
In the case of unordered use of fax machines or fax servers, there is a risk that sensitive data may be brought to the attention of unauthorized persons or not reach the desired destination in time.



## Examples 
* Faulty addressing can cause a fax to be sent to an unauthorized recipient. If address books and distribution lists are not maintained, faxes can be sent to recipients who should have been excluded from the mailing.
* A faulty administration of a fax server can lead to incoming faxes being sent to employees who should not be aware of the content.
