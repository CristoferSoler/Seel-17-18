#M 6.75 Redundant communication connections
Responsible for initiation: IS-Management-Team, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Depending on the availability requirements, the failure or failure of communication links can lead to significant impairments. This applies to both telephone and LAN or WAN connections. The sources of error can be very diverse, so that the cause of research often proves to be very difficult.

As the typical work environment becomes more and more networked, the failure of communication links can mean that important data and information can not be exchanged. As a result, work processes may be interrupted until the connection is reestablished or until alternative solutions have been found.

Therefore, it makes sense to provide alternative solutions for the different communication connections (depending on their protection requirements).



## Examples 
* The telephone connection of an operations center should be guaranteed not only via landline, but also via a mobile phone.
* For the connection of the e-mail server to the outside world a second should be provided in addition to the normal Internet provider.
* In addition to the e-mail connection or next to a fax server, there should also be a fax machine in case the network connection or the server fills out.
