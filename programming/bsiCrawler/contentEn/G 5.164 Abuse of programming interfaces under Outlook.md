#G 5.164 Abuse of programming interfaces under Outlook
Many software vendors provide programming interfaces in their tools and applications for reasons of interoperability. B. as Application Programming Interface (API). These allow you to use certain functions from other programs or to extend the functionality of the application. In addition to the positive benefits of the programming interfaces, they can also be used to develop malicious software and trigger their harmful effects via APIs.

Microsoft Outlook provides programming interfaces that allow users to write their own applications or feature enhancements (macros) that can send and receive messages, appointments, and tasks through the client. As a result, Microsoft Outlook can be misused to spread malicious software.



## Examples 
* An interior with programming experience creates a tool that regularly checks the released directories of the company network with specific search patterns such as patent applications and automatically sends found files to a competitor via Microsoft Outlook.
* A malicious macro erases e-mails unnoticed from the inbox of a user. The user can not promptly respond to a request that customers are complaining about.
