#M 2.390 Commissioning of WLAN components
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If WLAN components are taken out of operation, all sensitive information must be deleted. In particular, the authentication information for access to the WLAN and other accessible resources that are stored in the security infrastructure and other systems must be removed or declared invalid. This means, for example, that cryptographic keys must be deleted securely and certificates for digital signatures must be blocked.



## Examples 
* laptops
* PDAs, smartphones and similar devices with Wi-Fi support
* Wi-Fi enabled phones, printers and cameras
