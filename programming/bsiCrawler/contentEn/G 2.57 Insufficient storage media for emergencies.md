#G 2.57 Insufficient storage media for emergencies
When data needs to be restored after it has been destroyed, it is often necessary to re-install the backed up data on separate storage media. This is especially true for more complex data structures such. For example, databases may be necessary because recovery does not always work smoothly and without errors. If the storage capacity required for this is not kept available for emergencies, hasty action during the emergency may lead to further data losses.
