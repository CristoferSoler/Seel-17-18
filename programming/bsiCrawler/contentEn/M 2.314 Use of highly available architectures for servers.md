#M 2.314 Use of highly available architectures for servers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

The availability of business processes, applications and services often depends on the function of a central server. But the more applications that run on a server, the more resilient it must be. A server usually contains several potential sources of error (single points of failure), ie components whose failure can trigger the failure of the entire system: IEC, hard disks, power supply, fan, backplane, etc. Restoring the entire system may take a considerable amount of time in this case. In addition to the provision of spare parts, the following additional possibilities can be used to increase the availability:

* Cold Standby
* Hot standby (manual panning)
* Cluster (automatic panning) Load balanced ClusterFailover cluster


Each of these techniques offers a different level of availability and is usually associated with different costs.



## Examples 
* Server in smaller networks (intranet)
* Low traffic servers on the internet
