#G 1.18 Failure of a building
Buildings can become unusable unpredictably. This may be caused by partial or total destruction, such as fire, storm, flood, earthquake or explosion. However, a failure of a building can also be caused by the fact that access is no longer possible. This can for example be triggered by

* Blockage of the building environment in the event of a chemical accident, a bomb finding (and the associated subsequent demolition), flooding, surface fire or extensive isolation due to drastic soil changes (crater formation) due to civil engineering measures (eg construction railway construction)
* Failure of the central access control system, strike of the security guards or
* Blocking of the building due to asbestos contamination or because legally prescribed fire protection measures have not been adhered to and thus a use of the building has been prohibited for official reasons.


Depending on the type of Gebuudenutzung, z. B. Data centers, office buildings, warehouses, production halls or branches, the impact on business operations varies.
