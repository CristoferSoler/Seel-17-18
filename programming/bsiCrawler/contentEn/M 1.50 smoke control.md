Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Smoke is the largest personal injury to fire. More than 90% of fire deaths are caused by smoke (intoxication). But the IT hardware can also be significantly affected by smoke. Therefore, value should be attached to comprehensive smoke protection.

The following recommendations should be considered for smoke protection:

* Fire doors should be smoke-proof.
* Smoke protection doors in corridors should be controlled by smoke switches. Such doors can always be open, as they close automatically when smoke is detected.
* The ventilation system or the air conditioning system should permit smoke extraction from IT rooms. In ducted air ducts (supply and exhaust air), duct detectors should be installed.


In the fresh air intake, detectors should be installed, which automatically lock them when the heat (smoke) is detected.

After installation and alteration work, make sure that smoke control measures have been effective or restored.

Employees must be informed about the warning signals the smoke protection components have and how they should react.

The functionality of all smoke protection components must be checked regularly. It is also necessary to check whether penetrations for the realization of cabling in false floors and in suspended ceilings have been effectively sealed.
