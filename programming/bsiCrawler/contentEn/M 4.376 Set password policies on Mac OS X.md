#M 4.376 Set password policies on Mac OS X
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

For all Mac OS X clients, passport policies must be defined to provide them with a strong password. The described measures in M 2.11 Password Usage Control should be implemented under Mac OS X. The command line program pwpolicy can be used for this purpose. For example, this program can define a minimum number of letters and numbers, a minimum character length, or a maximum number of failed login attempts. A minimum password length of 8 characters is required if alphanumeric characters are used for the password. In addition, the password must be changed at regular intervals.

The following command sets a password policy that requires a minimum password length of 8 characters and allows 8 failed login attempts before the account is disabled.

pwpolicy -n / Local / Default -setglobalpolicy minChars = 8 maxFailedLoginAttempts = 8

In man (ual) pages on Mac OS X, you can see additional passphrase policy definition parameters.
