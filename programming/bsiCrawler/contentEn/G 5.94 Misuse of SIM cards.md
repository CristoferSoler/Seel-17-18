#G 5.94 Misuse of SIM cards
Every day, cell phones are lost or stolen. In addition to the immediate loss may result in further financial loss. If an unauthorized person also obtains a SIM card with the device, he can telephone at the expense of the rightful cardholder, provided that:

* he knows SIMPIN,
* no SIMPIN was set,
* the phone is switched on (standby without display password)
* or the SIMPIN rates can.


With the advent of data services via mobile phones, the legal risk of card misuse has also increased significantly. If the unauthorized person uses the SIM card, for example to download copyrighted material, to send spam e-mails or for denial-of-service attacks, the owner of the SIM card can initially be prosecuted.

Data such as phone book or text messages stored in the mobile phone or on the SIM card can be very confidential. A loss of the mobile phone or the card may mean the disclosure of this information stored.

The cryptographic security mechanisms of some network operators' SIM cards were weak compared to 1998. This made it possible to copy SIM cards from these network operators. To do this, however, the attacker had to have the original map at his disposal. In addition, the PIN must be known or the PIN query must be switched off so that the IMSI can be read out.

Users can almost prevent such an attack by setting a poorly guessable SIM PIN.
