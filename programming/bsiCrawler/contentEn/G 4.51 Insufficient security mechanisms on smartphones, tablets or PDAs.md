#G 4.51 Insufficient security mechanisms on smartphones, tablets or PDAs
An IT system that is in mobile use can be connected to a LAN via a VPN, so that the communication connection is very well protected. However, if this IT system itself is insufficiently protected against unauthorized access, there is a risk that an unauthorized person will use it as a gateway to access the internal network.

Typical terminals for mobile use are mobile phones or PDAs, which usually can not be separated by a user. This allows anyone who has access to the IT system to access all data and programs, including internal organization data or proprietary data.

Other unfortunately very typical weaknesses in mobile components such as PDAs are:

* insufficient access protection and authentication mechanisms
* no or inadequate ways to encrypt data
* unsecured synchronization
* no or insufficient logging capabilities


There are a variety of different PDA models with a variety of operating systems. The security features of the different PDA platforms are different, but currently none of the commercially available systems offer secure protection against manipulation.
