#G 5.205 Use of faked components
In the production process or in case of servicing the replacement of components, falsified components can be installed. This can also be done intentionally, since fouling is in circulation for many components. The goal for the mass production of faked components is financial and is achieved through their sale. The faked components are considerably less expensive to manufacture and the purpose of the Fälscher is to make the components as identical as possible to the original, so there are often no dedicated malfunctions.

Nevertheless, the falsifications often do not have the exact functionality of the original and are less reliable, especially because of cheaper production methods. If such failures are obstructed, the affected system may fail or malfunction, which can greatly harm people, the environment, and assets by transforming the higher level system.

Attackers can also deliberately develop a device or component that looks exactly like the original and whose function is manipulated to achieve a specific purpose. By means of such a component, for example, back doors could be installed, individual functions manipulated or availability could be attacked.
