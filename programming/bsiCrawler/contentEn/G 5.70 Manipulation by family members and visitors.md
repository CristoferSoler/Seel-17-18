#G 5.70 Manipulation by family members and visitors
In the home office is to be expected with relatives and visitors of the family, so that the danger exists that in case of insufficient security, the IT can be manipulated by this. It should also be considered that family-owned private software (eg computer games) could be used to help children destroy their IT or to transfer official data carriers for other purposes. These partly negligent or even intentional manipulations can affect the confidentiality and integrity of the official data as well as impair the availability of data and IT.
