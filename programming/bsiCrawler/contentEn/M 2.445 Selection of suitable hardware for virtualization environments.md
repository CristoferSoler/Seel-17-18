#M 2.445 Selection of suitable hardware for virtualization environments
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of Procurement

The common operating system and server virtualization solutions have individual requirements for the underlying hardware architecture or the equipment of the virtualization server with hardware components such as network interfaces or mass storage cards. These requirements must be considered when sourcing server systems if they are to be used as virtualization servers. There are some fundamental differences in hardware requirements for the different types of virtualization (operating system, hypervisor-based, and host-based server virtualization). These are shown below.



## Examples 
* Has the compatibility of the virtualization solution with the hardware used been checked?
* Is it ensured that the manufacturer of the virtualization solution used provides support for the operated physical hardware?
