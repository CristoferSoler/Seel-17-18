#M 3.77 Sensitization for safe internet use
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Supervisor, Head of Human Resources

Responsible for implementation: IT Security Officer, Human Resources

The Internet can be used in companies or public agencies for a variety of purposes and through a variety of services. This includes, for example, communication with customers via e-mail, instant messaging, discussion forums or blogs, the presentation of the institution via its own websites or the search for information. In order to be able to use the Internet safely from the point of view of an institution, the use of certain services or offers may be prohibited or restricted. Since the use of all unwanted services can not be technically prevented, among other things because new offers and services are constantly being added, it makes more sense to train the employees in how they can use the Internet safely and expediently , This also includes informing the employees about how they can avoid unwanted data traces when using the Internet through proper behavior and optimum configuration of the Internet applications, for example the browser.

Employees must be made aware of possible dangers and safety measures to be observed when using the internet. They should in particular be informed about

* the existing regulations of the institution for Internet use (there may be separate guidelines for dealing with e-mails, blogs, etc) in addition to a guideline for Internet use,
* the handling of downloaded files and the rules for installing software and plug-ins from the Internet,
* possible dangers of using the Internet and how the security measures taken against them act,
* active content, such as Java applets, ActiveX controls, and JavaScript, and the institution's decision on how to handle active content,
* the information policy of the institution, d. h.which information may not be disclosed on the internet, for example because the content is confidential or not suitable for publication,
* the correct behavior when using Internet services, since they act as employees on behalf of the agency or the company,
* Spam prevention strategies,
* legal requirements (copyright, eg regarding the use of material from the Internet, illegal, anti-constitutional or extremist content, pornographic content, etc.),
* Basic knowledge of encryption and digital signatures to be able to use the encryption and encryption programs correctly,
* the fact that information and offers on the Internet, as with many other media, originate from sources of varying trustworthiness and must be critically scrutinized or checked during further use.


Employees should not only be instructed once in the safe use of the Internet, but should always be informed about the latest developments. In addition to classical training courses, web-based interactive programs and information on the intranet are conceivable. Current developments can also be communicated with the help of newsletters or newsletters and at regular events such as departmental meetings.
