#M 4.390 Secure update of OpenLDAP
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

OpenCMR is constantly evolving from the developers of OpenLDAP. It therefore makes sense to replace the existing OpenLDAP installation with a newer version in case of software vulnerabilities.



## Examples 
* Often, administrators use their own scripts to automate tasks related to OpenLDAP. When updating OpenLDAP, such scripts must be checked to see if they work well with the updated version of OpenLDAP.
* In particular, if different versions of OpenLDAP are installed in parallel on an IT system, it is of great importance that the slap * tools of the respective version are always used. Tests of configuration and access rights must be carried out with the new versions of slaptest and slapacl, and the data backup must be imported with the new slapadd.
