#M 3.62 Training for the administration of directory services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

For the administration of a directory service detailed knowledge about the technology, about basic concepts as well as about the used product is needed. If such knowledge is not available, it can easily lead to misconfiguration with significant safety implications for the institution. Therefore, adequate training of the relevant administrators in this area is mandatory.



## Examples 
* Have all administrators been trained on the security functionality of the underlying operating system used by the directory service?
* Have all administrators been trained in dealing with the relevant client and server security mechanisms related to the directory service?
* In addition, have all administrators been specially trained in their role-based administration and delegation tasks?
