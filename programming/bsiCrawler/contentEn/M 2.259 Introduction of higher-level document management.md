#M 2.259 Introduction of higher-level document management
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

In electronic archiving, all archived documents must be clearly identified and reproduced. As this usually involves the administration of large volumes of data, the use of a higher-level document management system (DMS), even for small and medium-sized authorities or companies, is recommended.



## Examples 
* the setting of documents in the DMS,
* the use of the DMS when handling documents,
* the responsibilities for using and operating the DMS,
* the assignment of rights and the responsibility for this as well as
* the requirements for the operation of the DMS (Service Level Agreement).
