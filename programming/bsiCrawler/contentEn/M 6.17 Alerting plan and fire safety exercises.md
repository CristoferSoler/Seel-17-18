#M 6.17 Alerting plan and fire safety exercises
Responsible for initiation: Public authorities / management, fire protection officer

Responsible for implementation: fire protection officer

It is necessary to draw up plans for the emergency measures to be taken. In such a plan istz. B.niederzulegen,

* which measures have to be taken at which events,
* whether and how building parts may be vacated (persons and equipment),
* who is to inform and
* which help-giving forces are to be informed.


The alerting plan can be supplemented by behavioral rules for the case of fire, to be announced to all employees. See also module B 1.3 Emergency Management.

However, the best alerting plan will not help if there is no assurance that the actions listed therein are correct and workable. It is therefore necessary to regularly check and update the alarm plan. One of these tests is the performance of fire safety exercises.



## Examples 
* A fire protection exercise carried out in the fall of 2012 in a 21-storey office building in Bonn showed that many employees did not know where a fire extinguisher or where the next staircase is. In an emergency, this ignorance can lead to disaster. Partly the exercise was ignored, one did not leave the room for convenience.
