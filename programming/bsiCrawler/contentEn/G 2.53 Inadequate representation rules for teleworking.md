#G 2.53 Inadequate representation rules for teleworking
The tasks of the teleworker are usually designed so that he can work independently as far as possible. This entails the risk that, in case of illness, it is difficult to provide a representation for the teleworker. In particular, it may be difficult to provide the requisite documentation or data from the teleworker for the representative if there are no access opportunities to the teleworker's home office.
