#G 2.172 Lack or inadequate protection of personal data processing abroad
When transferring personal data abroad, special legal provisions must be observed. Personal data may be transmitted to the Member States of the European Union under the same conditions as within the Federal Republic of Germany. Personal data may only be transmitted to bodies in so-called third countries if an appropriate level of data protection (cf.   4b Abs. 3 BDSG) is guaranteed there, as provided for in the law (   4c Abs. 1 BDSG) or the responsible body has sufficient guarantees regarding the protection of the personal right and the exercise of the associated rights (  4 c Abs. 2 BDSG). In the latter case, the transfers must be approved by the supervisory authorities.



## Examples 
* A German company, which belongs to an internationally operating group, would like to change its previous national access and access management to a directory service, which is to be operated centrally in Japan by another subsidiary of the group.
* Japan does not (yet) have adequate data protection levels. The transfer of personal data to a Japanese customer is therefore only permitted if appropriate measures ensure an adequate level of data protection. This can be done by signing the so-called standard contract clauses between the German client and the Japanese contractor.
