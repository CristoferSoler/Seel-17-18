#G 2.7 Unauthorized exercise of rights
Rights such as access, access and access rights are used as organizational measures to protect information, business processes and IT systems from unauthorized access. If such rights are granted to the wrong person or if a right is exercised unauthorized, a variety of threats to the confidentiality and integrity of data or the availability of computer power can arise.



## Examples 
* The work preparer, who has no access authorization to the data carrier archive, removes magnetic tapes in the absence of the archive administrator in order to be able to import backup copies. Due to the uncontrolled removal, the inventory directory of the data medium archive is not updated, the volumes can not be found for this period.
* An employee is ill. A roommate knows from observations where he stores his password on a notepad and gains access to the other employee's computer. Since he has recently been informed by a telephone call that the colleague had yet to give a technical opinion, he takes this task unjustifiably true on behalf of his colleague, although he is not up to date on the subject matter. A subsequent creation of a tender document in the administrative department therefore requires a hardware component that has long since become obsolete in the specifications, because the employees there have trusted the expert opinion of the experienced colleague without any restrictions.
