#G 5.90 Manipulation of address books and distribution lists
On fax servers there is usually the possibility to carry address books and distribution lists. In address books u. a. the recipient fax numbers are stored. It is also possible to have several fax receivers in a group z. B. for the sending of serial faxes. The use of such address books is very convenient for the user since a recipient number stored once does not have to be entered manually again. In many cases, the users of a fax server no longer check the correctness of a recipient number entered in the address book before sending the fax. The same applies to the assignment of individual recipients to groups. Often, before sending out serial faxes, it is no longer checked whether the desired circle of recipients coincides with the members of a group.

Distribution lists can be used to allocate incoming faxes to (multiple) recipients.

If an unauthorized person can change address books and distribution lists, there is a risk that fax transmissions will be transmitted to undesired recipients. It is therefore also possible that the sending of a fax to the desired recipient is prevented. Naturally, the centrally managed address books and distribution lists are at particular risk.
