#M 2.34 Documentation of the changes to an existing system
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to ensure a smooth operation, the administrator must have an overview of the system or be able to procure. This must also be possible for his representative if the administrator unexpectedly completes. The overview is also a prerequisite to be able to carry out tests of the system (eg on problematic settings, consistency in changes).

Therefore, the changes that administrators make to the system should be documented, automated if possible. This applies in particular to changes to system directories and files.

When installing new operating systems or updating, the changes made must be documented with particular care. The behavior of the IT system (in particular also safety functions) may possibly be significantly changed by the activation of new or by the change of existing system parameters.

Under Unix, executable files to which users other than the owner have access or whose owner is root must be released and documented by the system administrator (see also M 2.9 Non-authorized use of hardware and software) , In particular, lists must be kept of the released versions of these files, which also contain at least the creation date, the size of each file, and any set s bits. They are a prerequisite for the regular safety check and for checks for a loss of integrity.
