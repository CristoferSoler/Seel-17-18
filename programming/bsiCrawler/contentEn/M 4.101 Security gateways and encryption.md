Since the data are sent on the Internet via unpredictable paths and nodes, the data sent should be encrypted as far as possible. Encryption of data traffic over the Internet can be realized in two different ways:

* Encryption on the security gateway or network elements that can be used to build secure subnets
* Encryption on the terminals, the z. B. is used by users depending on their needs


Both methods have specific advantages and disadvantages, which speak for one or the other variant depending on the application context.



## Examples 
* Are there security gateway requirements based on the organization's security requirements when it needs to encrypt communications with external partners?
