#M 4.471  view   about new, security-related features in Windows 8
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

From a security point of view, Windows 8 is, on the one hand, a logical further development of the Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating system systems, but in addition, new security functions have been introduced. This is partly due to the structure of the system: For example, the new apps can only be installed via the app store; the boot process for x86 processors on UEFI systems is secured by Secure Boot. In some cases, however, completely new functions have been introduced into the system (eg Windows To Go with its security-relevant configuration options).

The following overview shows the major, security-relevant changes of Windows 8 and refers to measures with further details. The upgrades of Windows 8 released in the meantime by Microsoft as Windows 8.1 are taken into account accordingly.



## Examples 
* Malicious Software Removal Tool
* SmartScreen: This feature for monitoring program calls is now system-wide. When using SmartScreen, data protection aspects should be taken into account (see measure M 4.472 Data parity in Windows 8 privacy guaranty).
* Possibility of using the Family Safety function for workplaces with restricted rights (eg kiosk mode). This feature allows you to limit it by using a web filter or application limitation
