#G 3.16 Incorrect administration of access and access rights
Access rights to an IT system and access rights to stored data and IT applications may only be granted to the extent necessary for the performance of the tasks. If these rights are administered incorrectly, there will be operational disruptions if required rights have not been assigned or security gaps if more than the necessary rights are granted.
