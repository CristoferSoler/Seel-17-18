#G 5.41 Abusive use of a Unix system using UUCP
The program package UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy) allows the exchange of ASCII and binary files between IT systems and the execution of commands on remote IT systems. UUCP was originally limited to Unix systems, but is now available for many other operating systems as well. When communicating via UUCP, IT users on remote computers are granted rights on the local computer. If these rights are not given carefully and limited to the necessary, there is a risk of abusive use of the local system. Also conceivable is a masquerade over UUCP by z. B. a host is presented with knowledge of the password.
