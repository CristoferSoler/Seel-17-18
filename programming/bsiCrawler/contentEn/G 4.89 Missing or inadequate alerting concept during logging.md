#G 4.89 Missing or inadequate alerting concept during logging
Products that store and evaluate log and monitoring data can often be integrated as optional components in an IT early warning system. IT early warning systems are deployed to alert you during a security incident, even before potential impacts are felt. This is especially effective for central logging. Sensibly evaluated log events can be used to detect such security incidents faster.

However, the monitoring must contain an alerting component. Otherwise it will have a negative effect on the availability, confidentiality and integrity of the systems, if the entire information network is monitored and the log data is also evaluated but not alerted.



## Examples 
* The responsible administrators for the IT early warning system detect pending entries in the log files of a security gateway. However, they will not go into the case as the entries come from a whitelisted system. The day before, an attack on the logging server was detected, but the triggered alarm interpreted as a false alarm. This allowed an attacker to gain access to the logging server and whitelisted the security gateway. Thus, the attackers were able to overcome the firewall unnoticed after a successful attack and penetrate into the internal network of the institution after further attempts.
