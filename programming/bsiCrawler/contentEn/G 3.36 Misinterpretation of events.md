#G 3.36 Misinterpretation of events
When using a management system, it is the task of the responsible system administrator to analyze and interpret the messages of the management system in order to then initiate appropriate measures. As a rule, the messages of the management system are based on monitoring mechanisms that automatically search system logs of various types for certain rules. It is not easy to automatically detect anomalies that indicate system errors from the accumulated log data and to generate appropriate messages to the system administrator. In addition, a mistake can even go undetected here. The incoming messages must therefore always be viewed and interpreted by the system administrator, since the messages (in the event of an error) are based on error symptoms and their (automatic) interpretation. A system administrator must also be able to recognize false alarms and false alarms here. If system messages are misinterpreted by the administrator, supposedly corrective countermeasures will lead to this. U. to an aggravation of the situation.
