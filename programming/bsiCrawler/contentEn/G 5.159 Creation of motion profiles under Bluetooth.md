#G 5.159 Creation of motion profiles under Bluetooth
If the Bluetooth interface is switched on for devices, it is possible to locate the position of these devices. This usually requires several Bluetooth receivers whose reception was ideally improved by additional antennas or amplifiers. Reaches of up to 2 kilometers have already been reached in laboratory environments in which Bluetooth devices could still be located. Depending on the nature of the attacker's equipment, it does not matter if the Bluetooth device is configured as visible or invisible.

In this case, it is also possible in principle to create a movement profile of a person if the positions of the Bluetooth device are recorded for a longer period of time, since the Bluetooth device ID always belongs to a device and thus mostly can also be assigned to a person.
