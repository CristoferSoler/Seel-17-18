#G 5.204 Intrusion and manipulation through the communication interface of embedded systems
Embedded systems are often limited in code size, timing, power consumption, cost, size and weight. They are therefore often not with sufficient security features, wiez. Strong cryptography. However, modern embedded systems are increasingly networked using widely used technologies and protocols, making them potentially vulnerable.

Attackers may attempt to manipulate data or software on an embedded system by misusing the standard communication interfaces and protocols for their own purposes. Are e.g.. For example, if the IP communication or Ethernet, WLAN, Bluetooth, and mobile or digital radio interfaces are not sufficiently secured, an attacker can take connections, delete messages, or invade a system and perform follow-on attacks.

Modern embedded systems are often remotely administered via the web. For this purpose, a minimized embedded web server is present on the system. Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities of such a web server.

Furthermore, an attacker can also try using other available communication interfaces, eg. B.USB ports to enter the system.
