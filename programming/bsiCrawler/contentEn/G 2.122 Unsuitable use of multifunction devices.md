#G 2.122 Unsuitable use of multifunction devices
Multifunction devices are a space-saving and cost-effective solution to provide users with the functions of scanning, printing, copying and often faxing. Multifunction devices often also contain an integrated communication connection for data connections and are connected to the telephone network. Both mains-enabled devices, which are available to a larger user group, and single-user solutions, for example with a USB interface, are offered.

Integrating scan, print, and copy capabilities into one device increases security requirements compared to individual systems, as these devices also provide a single point of failure. For example, if a functionality fails, the entire device must be repaired so that the unaffected functions can no longer be used during this time.

If a communication interface to the telephone network (eg fax modem) or Internet is integrated in a multifunction device, then central protection mechanisms, such as an existing security gateway, could be bridged. This could potentially result in unLAN's gaining access to the Internet.

Existing, but undocumented maintenance access from the manufacturer may also provide access to the LAN.
