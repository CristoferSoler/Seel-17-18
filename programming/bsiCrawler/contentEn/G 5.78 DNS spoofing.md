#G 5.78 DNS spoofing
In order to be able to communicate with another computer on the Internet, its IP address is required. Since such numbers are not very intrusive, the Domain Name System (DNS) assigns a name to such an IP address.

DNS spoofing is used when an attacker succeeds in falsifying the assignment between a computer name and the associated IP address, ie if a name is in a wrong IP address or the IP address is in one wrong name is converted. In classical DNS spoofing, the client PC is not manipulated by malware, but weak points in DNS communication are exploited. This allows, among other things, the following attacks:

* r services (rsh, rlogin, rsh): These services allow authentication based on the name of the client. The server knows the IP address of the client and asks about its name by DNS. Through DNS manipulation, an attacker can log in to the r-service without authorization and gain access to valuable information.
* Web spoofing: An attacker could assign the address www.bsi.bund.de to a wrong computer. When entering http://www.bsi.bund.de this wrong computer would be addressed.


How easy it is to do DNS spoofing depends on how the victim's network is configured. Since no computer can own all the DNS information in the world, it always relies on information from other DNS servers. In order to reduce the frequency of DNS queries, most Resolving DNS servers store information received from other DNS servers for a period of time.

Another way to do DNS spoofing damage is by breaking into a DNS server. This case should not be considered here. Rather, it's about identifying principal dangers when using DNS.



## Examples 
* A user on the computer pc.kunde.de first wants to access www.firma-x.de and then the competitor www.firma-y.de. In order to be able to access www.firma-x.de, he must request the associated IP address from his Resolving DNS server ns.kund.de. He does not know the address yet and asks the advertising DNS server ns.firma-x.de. This replies with the IP address, which is forwarded and stored by ns.kunde.de to the user. If in the answer package of ns.firma-x.de besides the IP address of www.firma-x.de there is also a wrong IP address for the computer name www.firma-y.de, it will be saved. If the user now tries to access www.firma-y.de, the own resolving DNS server does not ask any more about the DNS server ns.firma-y.de, but rather passes on the information provided by ns.firma -x.de were pushed. In current versions of DNS server products, attacking in this form is no longer possible. However, there are modified or improved variants of the attack, which are also successful in current versions.
* Company X knows that a user wants to access the competition computer www.firma-y.de with the computer pc.kunde.de. Company X prevents this by asking the DNS server ns.kund.de for the address www.firma-x.de. This must ask the DNS server ns.firma-x.de and gets as in the first example, the wrong information about www.firma-y.de back.
