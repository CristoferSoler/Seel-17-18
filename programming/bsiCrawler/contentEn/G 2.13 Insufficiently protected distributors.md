#G 2.13 Insufficiently protected distributors
Sub-distributions of the power supply network are often freely accessible and unlocked housed in corridors or Treppenh usern. This makes it possible for anyone to open these distributors, to carry out manipulations and, if necessary, to bring about a power failure. Furthermore, such distributors can pose an immediate danger, since direct removal of voltage-carrying parts is possible after removing screw-type fuses and their sockets. Open doors on the distributor rails can also hinder the traffic route, and even injuries due to jamming and pinching at the shearing edges are possible.
