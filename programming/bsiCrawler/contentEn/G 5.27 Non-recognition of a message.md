#G 5.27 Non-recognition of a message
With any type of communication, a communication participant can deny the message reception (Repudiation of Receipt). This is particularly important in financial transactions. A message reception can be denied during the mailing as well as with fax, e-mail or SMS use.



## Examples 
* An urgently needed spare part was ordered electronically. After a week's absence from work, the lack of goods was claimed. The supplier denies having ever received an order.
* Likewise it can happen that a communication participant denies the message dispatch, thus, for example, denies a completed order (Repudiation of Origin).
* On a public holiday, the administrator of an institution is notified by SMS that a server has failed. However, the administrator does not arrive at the institution and subsequently denies having received such an SMS. Due to the delay, the server fills longer time, resulting in economic damage.
