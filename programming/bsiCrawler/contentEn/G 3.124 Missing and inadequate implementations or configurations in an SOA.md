#G 3.124 Missing and inadequate implementations or configurations in an SOA
Current authentication, integrity, and encryption mechanisms can significantly improve the level of security in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). However, these measures must be used correctly or configured. For example, XML signatures only increase information integrity integrity when applied to all elements within the XML file and the signature is correctly validated when the messages are processed.

A signature for individual elements is syntactically possible, but may not be helpful. For it is not always obvious to recipients of an XML object that all other, unsigned elements could continue to be manipulated. In addition, there is a risk that signed elements are replaced by a replay attack and thus recognized as fully valid.
