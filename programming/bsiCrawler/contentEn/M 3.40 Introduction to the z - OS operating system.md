#M 3.40 Introduction to the z / OS operating system
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

In its basic structure, z / OS hardly differs from other operating systems. Its structure is divided into hardware-related functions, operating system processes and user processes. Between the actual Base Control Program and user processes, there are a number of subsystems, the most popular of which are the Job Entry Subsystem for handling batch processing, the Time Sharing option for interactive operation support, and the Unix System Services for Unix-compatible operation.

The following description applies to the OS / 390 and z / OS operating systems. For the sake of simplicity, only z / OS will be listed, any existing differences to OS / 390 will be addressed where they exist.



## Examples 
* Provision of TCP / IP and SNA services
* Load distribution on the network components in a sysplex network
* Control and control of VPN communication
* Implementation of the security components for applications
* Telnet 3270 and Secure Telnet 3270 support, Telnet / SSH to the Unix System Services of z / OS
* IPv6 support for the z / OS operating system
