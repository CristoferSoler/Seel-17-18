#G 3.66 Faulty character set conversion when using z / OS
Extended BinaryCoded Decimals Interchange Code (EBCDIC) and American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) are encoding tables that specify how letters, numbers, and other characters are represented by 8 and 7 bits, respectively.

z / OS systems work with EBCDIC code. Only HFS and zFS file systems (Hierarchical File Systems) used under USS (Unix System Services) allow both ASCII and EBCDIC storage. When exchanging data between z / OS systems and systems that work with ASCII code (eg also from USS to MVS), there is a risk that information will be mislaid if incorrect translation tables (Code Page Translation) to be used. Particularly frequently affected is the translation of special characters.



## Examples 
* In one company, data transfer between different OS / 390 and z / OS systems over an extended period of time using the FTP protocol did not cause problems. For an additional Unix system, the same FTP job was used and the EBCDIC-ASCII translation was performed with the default table. The transfer went without any problems at first, but further processing of the data sets in the Unix system showed that certain umlauts and special characters had not been correctly translated. Only after the creation of a special Translation Table, which was only used for this transfer, the error was corrected.
