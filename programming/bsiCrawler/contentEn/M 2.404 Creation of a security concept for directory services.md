Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

A security concept for the directory service has to be created. It regulates which services, components, etc. should and can be used in which way. The following list gives a rough overview of areas that should be regulated in the concept. The list must be adapted, designed and expanded according to the application scenarios in the institution. These specific security requirements must be aligned with the institution's overall security concept.



## Examples 
* How should the directory service servers be physically secured?
* Which directory service components may be used?
* Which administration tools should be used?
* How is the tree of the directory service structured and partitioned?
* To what extent are schema changes made and at what time?
* Which object classes with which attributes should be used?
* Which replications of which type should be created?
* Which computers are directory service servers and which computers should keep a replication?
* Which computers are to be particularly protected as root domains?
