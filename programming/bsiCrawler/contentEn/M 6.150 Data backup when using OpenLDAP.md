#M 6.150 Data backup when using OpenLDAP
Responsible for initiation: Specialist, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Data backups of the OpenLDAP server must be carried out regularly. They are an important prerequisite for correcting errors that have occurred and being able to restore deleted data.



## Examples 
* The slapcat tool generates the LDIF export according to the physical order of the objects in the database. If this file is inserted into a directory service using ldapadd or similar client applications, objects may not be able to be created if the superordinate objects have not yet been imported (because they are physically behind the subordinate database in the backed-up database) Objects have been stored).
* Client applications such as ldapadd communicate with the running slapd server via an existing encrypted network connection. The initial import of a backup in this way takes up a lot of time, bandwidth, and resources.
* Importing via ldapadd or other client applications requires a running slapd server to which write access is granted. There is a risk that incomplete data may already be accessed during an import by other clients, or that objects may be created or modified in ways that conflict with data sets that need to be restored.
