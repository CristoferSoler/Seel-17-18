#M 2.289 Use of restrictive z / OS identifiers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

For the management of the RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) security system, u. a. Identification with high authorization is required. To minimize the risk of misuse, the following rules should be observed:



## Examples 
* Are high privileges in the z / OS system only granted to users who need these rights for their activities?
* Is the assignment of the high-authorization attributes documented in the RACF?
* Is it prevented that highly authorized z / OS identifiers with the attribute SPECIAL run concurrently with UID 0 as superuser under USS?
* Has an audit procedure been established for the z / OS systems?
* Are at least two IDs created with the attribute SPECIAL after a new installation of the z / OS system and then the IBMUSER locked?
* Are RACF definitions not created under z / OS with the identifier IBMUSER?
* Is an emergency user procedure established for the z / OS systems?
