#M 2.350 Separation of SAP systems
Responsible for Initiation: Information Security Management, IT Leader

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If it is decided not to continue operating an SAP system because it is replaced by a newer system version on new hardware, for example, the points described below must be observed. The measures are intended to prevent an attacker from abusing the freed-up identity of the SAP system. The screening process must therefore ensure that the identity of the SAP system is deleted and rendered useless.



## Examples 
* Identities (ie technical users) under which the segregated system accesses,
* Trusts
* destinations
* Configurations of the transport system,
* Configurations of the central user administration,
* System Monitoring Configurations (Monitoring).
