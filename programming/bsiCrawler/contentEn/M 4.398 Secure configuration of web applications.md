#M 4.398 Secure configuration of web applications
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Administrator

If a web application is poorly configured, an attacker may be able to overcome existing security mechanisms. Therefore, it must be ensured that the web application is configured so that access is possible only via the intended, secure communication paths. Access to unneeded resources and functions should therefore be restricted.

The following points should be considered when configuring the web application:



## Examples 
* Will the web application only allow the HTTP methods that are required?
* Is it preferable to use the HTTP POST method to transfer sensitive data (such as form data)?
* Is confidential data transmitted exclusively over an encrypted transport channel?
* Is it not possible to switch to an unscrambled connection in case of a connection error in an encrypted channel?
* Are web application configuration files stored outside the web root directory?
* Is a separate system used to administer the web application, or is the web application administration interface accessible only from the administration network?
