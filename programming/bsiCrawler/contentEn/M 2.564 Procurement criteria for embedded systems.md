#M 2.564 Procurement criteria for embedded systems
Responsible for initiation: Public authorities / management, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, procurer

Embedded systems are procured as part of the development of higher-level systems or they are part of the higher-level systems to be procured. Together with the pure hardware and firmware, additional components and services can be procured.

If errors are made in the procurement of an embedded system, this can have negative consequences for the secure operation of the higher-level system or the secure execution of an application or specialist task. Therefore, before acquiring an embedded system, a list of requirements must be created to evaluate the systems or components in question. Based on the assessment, an informed purchasing decision can then be made to ensure that the embedded system meets safety requirements in practical operation. The list of requirements should essentially include the safety-relevant areas and criteria presented below.



## Examples 
* Can an effective process for supplying security-related firmware updates be established?
* Does the manufacturer inform the affected departments when security gaps become known?
* Does the manufacturer provide technical support who is able to provide information within a reasonable time or to correct malfunctions?
* Does the manufacturer provide training or manuals for the security of the embedded system?
