Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

After the decision to make one or several Internet PCs available for the use of Internet offers and services, a concept for the concrete realization should be created. In this concept, the functional requirements, safety requirements, required regulations, responsibilities as well as specifications for the technical realization and use should be defined.

It is recommended that at least the following aspects be considered when designing the system. Depending on the existing organizational constraints, additional points must be included in the concept. Notes on this can be found in the blocks  B 3.301 Security gateway (Firewall) and B 5.4 Web server.



## Examples 
* Has a usage concept been developed for the use of Internet PCs, which also contains the security requirements for Internet access?
* Is it clear in a concept which internet services can be used and which services are available on Internet PCs?
* Is the handling of data from the Internet determined, in particular with regard to further processing on other systems?
* Does the concept specify the requirements for the availability of Internet PCs and whether alternative solutions must be created for a failure?
* Are the responsibilities for administration and operation of Internet PCs and contact persons named?
