#M 2.533 Contractual aspects in the provision of web services
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: sales, contract management

If web services are provided to third parties, written agreements must be made between web service providers and web service consumers that ensure the security of service use, but also the traceability and correctness of the provision of services.

The specific design must be based on the protection requirements of the applications and business processes that are mapped by the web service. In particular, the availability often has a special focus, since the failure of a web service may affect further, dependent web services and applications and may thereby impair one or even several business processes ,

The following list includes aspects that should be checked when designing the contract with the web service consumer and taken into account according to the respective protection requirements.



## Examples 
* Type and extent of use of the web services by the consumer, purpose
* Professional advice and support of the web service consumer by the web service provider
* Training and documentation
* Customer information / legal changes
