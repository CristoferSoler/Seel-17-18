#G 2.39 Poor design of a DBMS
The concept of a database management system (DBMS) defines the requirements for selection, setup, operation and possibly expansion of the planned system.

The selection and use of standard database software requires careful planning, installation and configuration of the database management system (DBMS) to ensure trouble-free operation. The variety of possible dangers is to be clarified by the following examples.



## Examples 
* A DBMS is selected which is not executable in the planned deployment environment. This can result from the fact that the DBMS is bound to a specific operating system or the minimum hardware requirements are not met.
* The selected DBMS poses a security risk because the security mechanisms provided by the manufacturer are insufficient to ensure the required availability, integrity and confidentiality of the data.
