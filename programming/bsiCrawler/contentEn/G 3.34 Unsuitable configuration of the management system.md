#G 3.34 Unsuitable configuration of the management system
For the secure use of a network and / or system management system, a consistent configuration of all involved components is necessary. Although the individual components are usually managed from a central instance (manager), the management system consists of many individual components that are distributed among the network and system components to be managed (agents). A consistent configuration of such a system can be divided into two parts:

* On the one hand, the configurations of the network and system components (eg servers, routers) set using the management system must be consistent overall.
* On the other hand, the management software itself must be consistently configured.


If the consistency of the configurations is intentionally or unintentionally violated, the components no longer work together smoothly, which can lead to security problems. For example, a server or router could become inaccessible or access rights too open (see also G .3.38 Configuration and Operating Errors).
