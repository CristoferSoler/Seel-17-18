#M 5.24 Use of a suitable Faxvorblattes
Responsible for initiation: Head of Internal Service

Responsible for implementation: user, fax person

In order to achieve an orderly and comprehensible fax exchange, the use of a standardized fax form should be provided. This can be used in particular to check whether a received fax transmission has been completely received and printed out.

The fax form should include:

* Telephone number of the fax machine,
* Name of the sender (with telephone number and full address),
* Telephone number of a contact person for transmission problems,
* Name of the recipient (with the fax number and, if necessary, the complete address),
* Number of pages including fax sheet,
* if necessary urgent note (possibly tiered) and
* Signature of the sender.


The request to forward misdirected shipments or to inform the sender makes sense.
