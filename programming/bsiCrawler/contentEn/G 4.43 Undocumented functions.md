#G 4.43 Undocumented functions
Many application programs contain undocumented functions, functions that are not described in the documentation and that are unknown to users. For some operating systems or application programs, there is now literature that describes a large part of the known, previously undocumented functions and which is generally more comprehensive than the supplied manuals. Undocumented functions, however, do not have to be limited to tools that have useful effects. As long as these functions are not disclosed, it can not be ruled out that much damage can be done to them.

This is particularly problematic when the undocumented functions affect security mechanisms of the product, such as access protection. Such functions often serve as backdoors during the development or distribution of application programs.



## Examples 
* In various IT systems, the developers installed built-in (and forgotten) backdoors to facilitate maintenance, but also allowed administrators to gain administrator privileges with a trivial password.
* Many programs can (or even have to) be registered online with the manufacturer. For some of these programs, the online registration of the software included an overview of all programs stored on the hard disk at the same time.
* A software that is required for the use of a cloud service contains a deliberately built-in or unlocked backdoor. With their help, attackers can gain access to the systems of the cloud user.
