#M 2.200 Management reports on information security
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Public authorities / management, IT security officer

The tasks of the IT security officer include supporting the authorities or the management in assuming their overall responsibility for information security. An important basis for the decisions to be taken is clear and well-presented information on the current state of information security in the institution.

In order to manage and maintain the safety process, it is necessary to periodically review its effectiveness and efficiency and to evaluate these results at the management level. The aim here is to coordinate the further procedure in the security process with the management level. Therefore, any necessary changes to the security process, such as the security objectives or the security policy, should be identified. The results must be documented and the previous records maintained.



## Examples 
* Results of audits and data protection checks
* Reports on security incidents
* Reports on past successes and issues with the information security process
