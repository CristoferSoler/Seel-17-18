#G 5.128 Unauthorized access to data by introducing code into an SAP system
If an attacker can introduce ABAP code into an SAP system, unauthorized access to data is possible because the security of an SAP system must be implemented by the ABAP code.



## Examples 
* As part of a software update, a developer adds his own additional code to an SAP, which gives him remote access to all programs in the SAP system.
* An external attacker succeeds in storing his own transport files in the SAP transport directory through a weakness in a company-specific application. These are recorded and installed without testing and can thus develop their harmful effects.
