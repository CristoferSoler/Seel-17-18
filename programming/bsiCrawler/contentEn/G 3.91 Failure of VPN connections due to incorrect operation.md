#G 3.91 Failure of VPN connections due to incorrect operation
In addition to the technical failure, for example, due to component failure or power failure, there are a number of other circumstances that can lead to the failure of a VPN connection. If alarm signals or abnormal operating behavior are not detected in time, it is often impossible to counteract in time. This can lead to failures as well as improper or unreasonable actions in simple routine work or repairs. The main cause of failure due to misuse is the inadequate training of the parties involved. Problems can not only arise on the side of the administrators, often users also contribute to misconduct or overload of the VPN services.



## Examples 
* A multi-site business uses a VPN to connect the properties together. Switching to a more recent software version of all VPN components that is not compatible with older versions required a reconfiguration of all VPN systems. Since the failure had to be kept as short as possible during the configuration and there was only one VPN administrator in the company, the system and normal network administrators also had to configure the VPN components. After an untrained employee entered VPN configuration parameters incorrectly, a location was not available for a long time.
