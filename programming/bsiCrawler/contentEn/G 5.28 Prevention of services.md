#G 5.28 Prevention of services
Such an attack, also called denial of service, aims to prevent users from using functions or devices normally available to them. This attack is often associated with distributed resources in that an attacker uses these resources to the detriment of other users at work. For example, the following resources can be artificially curtailed: processes, CPU time, disk space, inodes, directories.

This can be done, for example, by:

* starting any number of programs at the same time,
* multiple programs that consume much CPU time
* occupying all free inodes in a Unix system, so that no new files can be created,
* uncoordinated allocation of tape inz / OS systems, so that applications must wait for free tape stations and online processing is restricted,
* deliberately incorrect entry of passwords (also script-controlled) with the aim of blocking all identifiers of an az / OS system,
* the sending of certain constructed data packets that may cause the receiver to malfunction or overload due to software vulnerabilities (for example, by calling excessive cryptographic operations);
* the targeted overload of the network,
* the caps of network connections
* The targeted generation of XML messages with large amounts of data, recursive content, a large number of nesting and faulty DTDs, so that an XML parser intensively occupies its system's memory resources.
