#G 3.94 Misconfiguration of Samba communication protocols
Samba uses a variety of protocols for network-wide communication:

* Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC), a special form of Distributed Computing Environment Remote Procedure Call (DCE RPC)
* Network Basic Input / Output System (NetBIOS)
* Server Message Block (SMB)
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) / Internet Protocol (IP)
* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)


Incorrect configuration of the communication protocols may affect the availability and security of the services provided by a Samba server.
