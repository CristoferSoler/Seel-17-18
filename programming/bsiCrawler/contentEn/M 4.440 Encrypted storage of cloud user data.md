#M 4.440 Encrypted storage of cloud user data
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In addition to encrypted transmission over public networks, encrypted storage of cloud user data may be required to prevent stored information from administrators or other cloud service provider employees.

The encryption of cloud data assets can be configured in such a way that the cloud service provider provides and uses the encryption means, ie the procedure and keys lie with him. Alternatively, the cloud user may have the key while the cloud service provider merely provides the encryption. The latter is to be preferred, if this allows the technical possibilities of the used cloud service model.

Encryption of cloud data must be done using a suitable encryption algorithm and in such a way that data loss in the event of a malfunction (power failure, interruption of the process) is intercepted by the system.

The selection of a suitable encryption algorithm should, according to M 2.164, select a suitable cryptographic method.

The implementation of encrypted storage depends heavily on the service model (PaaS, IaaS, SaaS) and the architecture provided:



## Examples 
* Are confidential cloud user data encrypted in such a way that the cloud administrator has no access to the information?
