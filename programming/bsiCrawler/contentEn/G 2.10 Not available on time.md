#G 2.10 Not available on time
The correct use of data carriers is of particular importance for many business processes and IT processes. Already minor errors, z. B. Inadequate labeling, incorrect storage location, missing input or output confirmations in the data carrier archive, can lead to the fact that a data carrier can not be found in the required time. The resulting delays can lead to considerable damage.



## Examples 
* When creating a business report, it turns out in one company that the signed auditor's report was not found on the file. Since this was necessarily required in the original, a lot of effort in the search in the entire file inventory. Although the report was finally found, the annual report could not be completed on schedule.
* Backup tapes are accidentally outsourced to an external backup archive. A required data reconstruction is considerably delayed because it is not immediately possible to retrieve the tapes.
