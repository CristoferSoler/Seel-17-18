#G 3.54 Use of unsuitable data carriers during archiving
For the storage of data, data carriers are used, each of which has a defined field of application and period of use. In this case it may happen that for storage permanent or temporary data carriers are used that do not meet the requirements.

Typical causes for this are, for example

* Errors in the procurement or ordering of data carriers,
* inadequate stockpiling, so unintentional media must be used to prevent data loss,
* incorrect marking of the data carriers or
* Insufficient knowledge about the area of ??use of the data carrier.


The use of unsuitable data carriers can lead to data loss, which can only occur after a longer storage period.
