#M 4.60 Disabling unneeded ISDN router functionality
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In addition to service functions or remote maintenance (see M 2.108 Remote maintenance of the ISDN network interface elements), functions of the router operating systems can also lead to security gaps. For example, calling a Telnet session on the router and then manipulating the Management Information Base is possible if it is equipped with a Unix operating system.

As far as possible, these unneeded functionalities should be deactivated, preferably by removing the respective software module. If card functionality can only be configured by means of parameters, the correct setting of the parameters must be checked regularly.
