#M 6.103 Redundancy for the Prima cabling
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT

Often, in larger properties, several buildings are connected to a data center, which is located in one of these buildings, star-shaped. It is to be examined whether, at least for important buildings, a redundant, primary IT cabling over independent routes should be created.

It should also be checked whether the connections to IT or telecommunications providers should be designed redundantly. In order to create a real redundancy, it must be clarified with the provider, whether the connection to a carrier network is really created at different locations (local exchanges).

Whether a redundant primary cabling or a redundant connection to the provider is required depends on the availability requirements of the institution.



## Examples 
* Has it been checked whether redundant primary cabling or a redundant connection to the provider is required due to high availability requirements?
* Does a regular check of the functionality of the redundant cabling take place?
