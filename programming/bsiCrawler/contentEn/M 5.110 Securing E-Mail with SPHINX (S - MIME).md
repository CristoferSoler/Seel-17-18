#M 5.110 Securing E-Mail with SPHINX (S / MIME)
Responsible for Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

The growing importance of e-mail requires the use of measures that ensure confidentiality and commitment. This can be achieved by the wide use of encryption products and digital signatures of e-mails. The electronic signature ensures that the e-mail comes from the specified sender and is unchanged. Encrypting the information ensures that only the legitimate recipient can read the e-mail.

For this purpose, the BSI initiated the project SPHINX, in which cryptographic products were further developed to international standards. Interoperability, which means the flawless interchangeability of cryptographically handled messages, products of different manufacturers and for different platforms, is examined quarterly by a test laboratory and the result is published.



## Examples 
* Are the responsibilities for administration and technical user support regulated?
* Are users trained for the product, including necessary cryptographic fundamentals?
* Are there rules on storage and retention of keys and passwords against their loss and compromise?
