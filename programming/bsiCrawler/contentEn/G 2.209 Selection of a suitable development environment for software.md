#G 2.209 Selection of a suitable development environment for software
If an unsuitable development environment is selected for the development of a software, many problems can arise. For example, if various programming languages ??are used in software development, the chosen development environment may not be compatible with one or more programming languages. If no particular development environment is actively selected, different developers may work with different software tools selected by themselves, which may cause compatibility issues.

If a development environment is selected unsuitable or uncontrolled, urgently needed functions may be missing or not implemented in sufficient form.

Furthermore, an inappropriate development environment may also contain defects or vulnerabilities that can cause significant disruption in the course of software development.



## Examples 
* A Java project has to be changed several times so that variables and classes have to be renamed. If a development environment without functions for automatic reformatting of source code and structures (refactoring) is used, even these minimal changes represent a considerable amount of work and a potential source of error.
* In September 2015, attackers managed to integrate malicious code into iOS apps by providing developers with a malicious version of the Xcode development environment. Various apps created with the so-called XcodeGhost have been released and have reached several million devices.
