#G 3.75 Poor control of batch jobs on z / OS
z / OS operating systems are still used extensively to perform batch jobs. A batch job consists of one or more individual steps (job steps).

The input to a batch job is either one / more file (s) or corresponding control cards that are supplied via the Job Entry Subsystem (JES2 / 3). Output management is also done by the Job Entry Subsystem.

The control of batch jobs essentially consists of starting, monitoring the process and checking the result (usually in the form of a return code). Depending on the return code, subsequent batch jobs often have to be started. The higher the number of jobs and the complexity of the processes, the higher the probability of error.



## Examples 
* The abort of a batch job was not registered during batch processing. Only the online processing the next day showed the errors in the datasets. To correct the problem, online processing had to be stopped, data must be reloaded, and batch processing should then be repeated. During this time online processing was not available.
