#M 5.114 Securing the z / OS trace functions
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Trace functions can be used to analyze errors during connection establishment under z / OS. They can be used in both VTAM (Virtual Telecommunication Access Method) and TCP / IP. The GTF (Generalized Trace Facility) is used to capture and evaluate the trace data. In addition, the functions NLDM (Network Logical Data Manager - a NetView component) and ACFTAP (Advanced Communication Facility Trace Analysis Program) are also available for the evaluation of VTAM data.

Trace functions not only display errors, but also allow the representation of the transmitted data itself. Therefore, the following notes should be observed:



## Examples 
* Is it ensured that only employees can initiate traces on z / OS that require GTF in the course of their work?
* Are the GTF evaluations on z / OS protected so that only the responsible employees have access to them?
* Is the trace feature of NLDM disabled on z / OS?
* Is ACFTAP on z / OS protected so that only the responsible employees have access to this program?
* Are the session data encrypted in the z / OS trace function to protect passwords against unauthorized reading during transmission?
