#G 5.157 Phishing and Pharming


## Examples 
* Many online banking users received emails that appeared to come from the service department of their bank. They were informed that they should log in to the specified website with their default banking password due to service changes and unlock the new services with a TAN. The website looked authentic, but had nothing to do with the bank mentioned, but was prepared by attackers and posted on the Internet. The purpose of the website was solely to collect access to foreign accounts for the attackers. Similar attacks also occurred on users of popular e-commerce and auction websites.
