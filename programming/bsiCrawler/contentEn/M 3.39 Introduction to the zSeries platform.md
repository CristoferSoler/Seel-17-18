#M 3.39 Introduction to the zSeries platform
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

The zSeries architecture is the successor to the 1964 introduced S / 360 architecture and is commonly used in today's mainframe installations. The zSeries systems (as part of IBM's eServer family) can be used for both batch processing and transactions, as well as for e-business applications.

For operating the zSeries platform, the operating systems OS / 390 (31  bit architecture) and z / OS (64  bit architecture) are available. Since the z / OS operating system succeeds OS / 390, it should be used on new installations.

The following sections provide an overview of the components of the zSeries platform, but they are not exhaustive. Extensive and detailed information can be found in the relevant literature of the manufacturer IBM (see references at the end of the action description).

The z / OS operating system is described in the entry M 3.40 Introduction to the z / OS operating system, the operating system Linux f rz / OS in the M .3.41 Introduction to Linux and z / VM for zSeries systems.
