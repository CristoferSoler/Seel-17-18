#G 2.16 Unordered user switching on portable PCs
Changing users on portable PCs, such as laptops or notebooks, is often done by simply handing over the device. As a result, it is usually not ensured that the device no longer stores any data that requires protection and that the device is not contaminated with a computer virus. In addition, it is no longer understandable after some time, who has used the portable PC or who currently uses it. The unordered change of user without storage controls and without corresponding documentation can thus lead to the restriction of the availability of the device and to the confidentiality loss of remaining data of the hard disk.

As of July 1999
