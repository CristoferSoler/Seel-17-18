#M 6.66 Postprocessing of security precautions
Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, auditor

You can learn something from every security incident. In order to be able to derive the maximum learning effect from an occurred security incident, the post-processing must not be neglected. Often improvements can be made in dealing with security incidents or draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the security management or the existing security measures. Among other things, the following aspects should be considered:



## Examples 
* Has a standardized follow-up of the last safety incidents been carried out?
* Was it investigated how quickly security incidents were noticed and resolved? Was it checked whether the reporting channels were working, if sufficient information was available for the evaluation and if the detection measures were effective? Were the actions and activities taken effective and efficient?
* Was the experience gained from past security incidents used to generate instructions for comparable security incidents?
* Are the instructions given to the relevant groups?
* Are the instructions regularly updated on the basis of new findings?
* Is there an annual briefing of the management level on the security incidents?
