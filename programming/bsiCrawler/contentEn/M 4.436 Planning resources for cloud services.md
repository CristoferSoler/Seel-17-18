#M 4.436 Planning resources for cloud services
Responsible for initiation: Department, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: specialist responsible

When planning a cloud infrastructure, a number of framework conditions must be taken into account.

In addition to questions about the virtualization technology to be used and the products to be used for this purpose, the suitability of the cloud elements (hardware, software and network connection) and the network structure and storage connection to be realized with it must be planned. When planning the cloud infrastructure, the compati- bility of IT systems and (administrative) software solutions must also be checked by various providers.

The results of the planning must therefore be selection decisions for hardware and software as well as for network structure and storage connection. The planning should document the characteristics (sizing, throughput, etc.) of the hardware, software and connections based on or on which the selection was made. This should in particular include consideration of the compatibili- ty of the constituents.



## Examples 
* fast and extensible connections to CPU, memory and storage resources.
* Connections in storage networks for access to mass storage components.
* Connections to infrastructure systems such as DNS, DHCP and directory service servers.
* Connections to infrastructure services such as malware signature update servers.
