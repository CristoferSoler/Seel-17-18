#M 5.7 network management
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT

Networks can be managed centrally or locally at the individual nodes. In addition to the technical possibilities, this depends on who administers the network node. In any case, a central coordination of all network activities of a government agency or a company is necessary in order to avoid redundancies. Central should be controlled:

* the selection and laying of cables,
* the choice of IT systems and applications used to avoid incompatibilities
* the central allocation of network addresses and user IDs,
* the organizational allocation of network components z. B. to departments.


The individual network nodes and the IT systems connected there can also be managed locally.

The tasks and responsibilities of the system administrators must be clearly specified and clearly defined (see also M .2.26 Appointment of an administrator and a representative).
