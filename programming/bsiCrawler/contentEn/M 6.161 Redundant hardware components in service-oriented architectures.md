#M 6.161 Redundant hardware components in service-oriented architectures
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

If an SOA platform is implemented, care must be taken to provide redundant hardware components for important services that can be activated within a tolerable period of time. This ensures that operation can be continued even when a service is completed.

Furthermore, the services should be regularly backed up so that they can be quickly set up and run again on a different hardware after a failure. In the information security concept, measures must be defined for the case of a hardware defect and, for example, contact persons and sources of supply for replacement hardware must be mentioned (see M 6.160 Emergency preparedness concept for SOA environments).

However, a failure can only be compensated if the alternative service is also made known to the service users. In the context of an SOA platform, this can be done using WS Discovery, for example. Without such automatic signaling, a failure can only be bridged with considerable manual effort.
