#M 2.523 Secure automation of cloud rule processes
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Cloud Computing provides a shared pool of configurable cloud resources (eg, networks, servers, storage systems, applications, and services) with minimal overhead or interaction from the cloud service provider. For this, the requests of cloud services and their provisioning must be automated. The challenge for cloud service providers is to deploy resources in the shortest possible time while still ensuring information security. At the same time, cloud service providers are striving for business reasons to uphold the server load of the cloud infrastructure and to minimize the running costs.

Automation of cloud rule processes currently exists mostly in the scripted sequence of configurations via the cloud management software. Secure automation of cloud rule processes occurs when the scripted configurations are implemented correctly.



## Examples 
* Provisioning and de-provisioning (also: orchestration)
* Registration of cloud services in the services catalog
* Monitoring cloud resources and cloud service usage
* Access and access management for cloud services
* Maintaining cloud services
