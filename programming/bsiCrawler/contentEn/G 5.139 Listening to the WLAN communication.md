#G 5.139 Listening to the WLAN communication
Since radio is a shared medium, the data transmitted over a WLAN can be easily recorded. From the recorded data, among other things, the following information can be obtained:

* WLAN parameters such as SSID, used radio channel and used encryption method
* MAC addresses of the communication partners in the WLAN


Furthermore, the broadcasters and multicasts of all stations in the broadcast domain, in some cases also stations in the cable-based LAN, can be monitored on the WLAN, provided that these packets are not filtered at the access point. An attacker can thus, despite functioning encryption, at least determine the MAC addresses, and thus the manufacturers of all stations in the broadcast domain, as well as used multicast addresses and thus obtain information about the use of Layer 2 protocols , In case of inadequate encryption, for example, NETBIOS browser messages and thus information about server services in the LAN are directly accessible.

In the case of unused or weak encryption, the following information can still be accessed:

* IP addresses and used ports of the communication partners of the WLAN
* Possibly transmitted user data, if not protected by VPN, SSL or other encryption mechanisms at the application level.
