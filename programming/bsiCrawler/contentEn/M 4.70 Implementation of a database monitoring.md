Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to ensure availability, database integrity and confidentiality of data, periodic database monitoring is required, and monitoring periods must be performed in accordance with well-defined monitoring periods. Aspects to be considered in this context, which are briefly explained below, include the data fragmentation within the database, the current data volume and its change with regard to the available resources (degree of completion) as well as the utilization of the database.



## Examples 
* Size of the first and subsequent extent in bytes
* Growth of all other extents in percent, this number being in relation to the size of the second extent
* Maximum number of extents that can be created for the table
* Reserved blocks for later changes in percent
