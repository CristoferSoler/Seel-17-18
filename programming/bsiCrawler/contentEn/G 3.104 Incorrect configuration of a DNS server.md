#G 3.104 Incorrect configuration of a DNS server
Security-critical defaults, self-configured security-critical settings, or faulty configurations can cause a DNS server to malfunction and restrict availability. Furthermore, faulty configurations make it easier to attack the availability and integrity of the DNS server. In the safety-critical configurations, the following points are of particular importance:



## Examples 
* The permissions have been set too restrictive so that the DNS server does not accept the updates from the internal DHCP server. As a result, the domain information can not be updated and queries will return outdated, incorrect data in response.
* Setting the permissions too generously may pose a potential attack vulnerability, as described in G5.555 Utilizing dynamic DNS updates.
