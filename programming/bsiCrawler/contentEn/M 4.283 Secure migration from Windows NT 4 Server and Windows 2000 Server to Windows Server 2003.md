#M 4.283 Secure migration from Windows NT 4 Server and Windows 2000 Server to Windows Server 2003
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Updating a legacy version to Windows Server 2003 usually has different reasons and has multiple goals. The starting positions are organizationally and technically very diverse. Therefore, the comprehensive and careful planning of a server update, taking into account the goals to be achieved, is indispensable. The requirements in M 2.315 Server Use Planning and M 2.319 Server Migration are to be observed. For the migration of a Windows NT server, the definitions from M 2.233 Planning of migration from Windows NT to Windows 2000 also apply in principle.
