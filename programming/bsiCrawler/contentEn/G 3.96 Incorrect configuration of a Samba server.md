#G 3.96 Incorrect configuration of a Samba server
To show some of the capabilities of the Samba server and to give administrators a quick start, installing the Samba server creates the smb.conf configuration file with default settings. If, however, this configuration file supplied as an example is taken over directly or only with minor modifications, this can lead to considerable security gaps. When modifying the configuration file, you may encounter several errors:

* If the exemplary file shares are not commented out, sensitive information can be viewed in these unwanted shares.
* Binaries of Samba often contain functions that are not needed. If administrators are unaware of these features, it may compromise the security and availability of the services of a Samba server. An example of this would be the -enable-cups parameter for the configure script at compile time. It determines if Samba will be compiled with or without Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) support.
* The Samba configuration contains default values ??for certain settings that affect the performance of a Samba server. Changing these settings without knowing the implications may degrade performance or even compromise the availability of Samba server services. Often the effects of a change are not immediately visible. An example of this is the configuration parameter allocation roundup size.
