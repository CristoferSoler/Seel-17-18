#M 1.57 Current infrastructure and construction plans
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: planner

Construction plans, escape route plans, fire brigade maps etc. (see also M 1.11 Location plans of the supply lines and M 5.4 documentation and labeling of the cabling) should be brought up to date immediately after each refurbishment, extension of the infrastructure and safety technology ,

This is required to

* keep the defined security level,
* Optimally responding to emergency situations,
* Facilitate revisions and
* To be able to plan and implement measures fully and appropriately.


It is not sufficient, for example, to store the plots only with the responsible building management. In case of damage or emergency, eg. In the event of cable damage or water pipe breakage, important time for fault localization and elimination can be lost. The one who manages the plans, z. B. in the household service, should also be able to read them. If necessary, personnel must be trained and instructed accordingly.
