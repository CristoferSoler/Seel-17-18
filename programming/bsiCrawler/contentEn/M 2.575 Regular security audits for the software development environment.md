#M 2.575 Regular security audits for the software development environment
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer, Head of Development

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Head of Development

Employees or service providers who are not part of the development team should perform regular security audits of the development environment and the test environment. In doing so, the security activities regarding the development projects and the status of the secure implementation in the development environment should be checked. The safety audit must be based on defined and documented specifications and their compliance must be checked.

All employees should be made aware of the need for safety-related information security measures and why they need to be implemented.

As part of the audit, the security of the development environment is tested and at least the following aspects should be checked:

* Update of the development and test environment (version, patches, updates, virus protection and known vulnerabilities)
* Functionality of the development and test environment (eg configuration and operating conditions)
* Access restrictions to the development and test environment (authorized and unauthorized users)
* Access restrictions on development and test data (eg code, externally incorporated libraries and compiled software modules)
* Access restrictions to further data in connection with development and testing, especially in the case of increased protection requirements (eg documentations of interfaces or secret functions)
