#M 4.271 Virus protection for SAP systems
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Head of Development, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer

With the version SAP NetWeaver 04 the possibility was created to connect an external anti-virus program to SAP systems. This allows all ABAP and Java stack applications to scan the processed data for computer viruses. For this purpose, the virus scanner interface for anti-virus programs was defined, which however must be explicitly addressed by the respective programs.

In the case of in-house developments or additional software from third-party manufacturers for SAP systems, care should be taken to support the interface for anti-virus programs. This applies to scenarios in which data is loaded into an SAP system and offered to other users for download. It is recommended that the third-party software procurement criteria for SAP systems be checked to see if they support the anti-virus program interface.

The use of anti-virus programs in the SAP environment must be coordinated with the authority or company-wide computer virus protection concept.

Information on the documentation for the anti-virus program interface can be found in M 2.346 Using the SAP documentation.
