#M 2.71 Defining a policy for a security gateway
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

The policy of the security gateway determines the behavior of the security gateway. It defines what information, services, and protocols the security gateway can handle and how to use. The policy should not be confused with the security policy for the security gateway, which sets out rules for the secure operation of the security gateway itself.



## Examples 
* What information may be allowed in and out through the security gateway?
* What information should the security gateway hide (eg internal network structure or usernames)?
* Which authentication methods should be used within the network to be protected or for the security gateway (eg one-time passwords or smart cards)?
* Which accesses are required (eg only via an Internet service provider or via a modem pool)?
* What data throughput is to be expected?
