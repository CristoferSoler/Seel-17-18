#M 4.19 Restrictive attribute assignment for Unix system files and directories
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The measures mentioned here apply to files and directories for which the administrator is responsible, ie those which are either of importance to all users or serve the purpose of administration. It is not enough to check the rights of a program, it must also check the rights of all programs that are called from this program (especially to avoid Trojan horses).

As far as possible, the attributes of all system files should be set so that only the system administrator has access to them. Directories may only provide the necessary privileges to users.

The s bit should only be set if absolutely necessary. For shell scripts, the s-bit should not be set. The s-bit may only be set by the administrator, the necessity for this is to be justified and documented.

In directories where all users must have write access (eg. / Tmp), the t-bit (sticky bit) should be set.

The integrity of all attributes set on Unix system files and directories should be regularly verified, eg. with Tripwire (see also M 4.26 regular security check of the Unix system).
