#G 5.8 Manipulation of lines
In addition to the monitoring of lines (see  5.7 Monitoring of lines) further deliberate manipulation or even the destruction of IT lines pose a danger to the institution. Primarily the primary cabling gr   Institutions and lines that implement the IT or telecommunications connections to a provider often have a high need for protection in terms of availability.

Malfunctions of lines can be deliberately and manipulatively brought about. This is possible, for example, by:

* Preliminary incorrect patching of cables or connections
* Preliminary incorrect insertion of cables
* Deliberately caused incorrect operation or destruction of cables
* Consciously induced violation of given bending radii with fiber optic cables
* Conscious contamination of connectors (eg optical transmission media, Fiber Channel)


Such manipulations often pursue the goal of disrupting the IT operation or causing financial harm to the institution.



## Examples 
* During finishing work on the premises of a large company, attackers managed to open a service shaft in the poorly access-protected construction site area. With a pruning shears a glass fiber bundle of the primary cabling was cut. With some production buildings cut off from the IT network, operations were disrupted and partially disrupted, causing millions of dollars worth of damage.
