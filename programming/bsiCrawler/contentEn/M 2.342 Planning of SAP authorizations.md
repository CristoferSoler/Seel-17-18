#M 2.342 Planning of SAP authorizations
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager



## Examples 
* Which roles are needed?
* Which role may which functions of the SAP system call (eg transactions, programs or reports)?
* Which role is allowed to access which data of the SAP system?
* Which administrative roles and which permissions are required to implement the planned administration concept?
* Are applications still using other authorizations besides the SAP standard authorization system? These are to be considered and planned accordingly.
* Which authorization management processes are to be defined with the associated responsibilities (eg application, approval, creation, modification, deletion)?
* Are segregation aspects sufficiently considered in the authorization concept? In particular, legal requirements also play a role here.
* Does the change management also consider the risk potential that can arise from a claim for authorization?
