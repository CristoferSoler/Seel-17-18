#G 5.75 Overloading of incoming e-mails
An e-mail address can be deliberately blocked by continuously sending large e-mails (possibly with meaningless content). This can happen, for example, because a user has disregarded the Netiquette and thereby made unpopular or because the institution is to be attacked. Netiquette (the net etiquette) refers to the eligibility rules that have been established over time in the use of the Internet, in particular in the newsgroups, and which are intended to ensure that everyone has access to the Internet efficiently and effectively of all satisfaction.

Due to the generously generated high volume of traffic, the local mail system can be overloaded, rendering it inoperative. This can even assume such proportions that the provider takes the user or his entire institution from the network.

A mail system can also be overloaded when employees participate in e-mail chain letter actions. Thus, in the mid-eighties, a chainmail campaign at Christmas worldwide paralyzed many IT systems. Users received an e-mail with Christmas greetings and an attractive graphic and were asked to copy this e-mail and forward ten other users.
