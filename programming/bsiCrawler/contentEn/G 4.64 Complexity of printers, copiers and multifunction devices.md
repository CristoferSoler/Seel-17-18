#G 4.64 Complexity of printers, copiers and multifunction devices
Network printers, high-performance copiers and multifunction devices are now complex IT systems. Not only do they offer extensive equipment and extended functional scope, but they can also bring new dangers to other IT systems or the LAN.



## Examples 
* An attacker redirects a specific expression to a printer that the user will not use. In this way, the attacker can also view documents with a higher protection requirement with regard to confidentiality. The user does not find the desired expression in the printer and suspects technical problems. Without thinking that this could be an attack, the user creates a new printout that can be taken from the output tray.
* The Bugbear worm has been known since the end of September 2002. It spreads via e-mail and network shares. A possible side effect of Bugbear is that print jobs with nonsense content are sent to all shared network printers on their own and may then be printed. As a result, printers can be blocked or consumables could be wasted.
