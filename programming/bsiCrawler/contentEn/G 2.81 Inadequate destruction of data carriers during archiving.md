#G 2.81 Inadequate destruction of data carriers during archiving
Archive systems with their storage media generally do not provide access protection for the stored data. This function is instead performed by the higher-level document management system (DMS). If archive data carriers are accessible outside the archive environment (archive system and DMS), it can be assumed that anyone who can read the medium can access the information stored there.

Especially when archived data is copied to new data carriers, there is a considerable risk that old, no longer used archival media that is not properly and completely destroyed will be misused for information retrieval.

Even with encrypted archived data, improper destruction of data carriers can be a problem since the security of crypto algorithms can only be guaranteed for a limited time (see G4.47 Obsolete crypto procedures). Therefore, a one-time encryption does not permanently protect against data misuse.
