#M 4.476 Protection of a WS-Notification Subscription in the Broker
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

A NotificationConsumer can subscribe to a NotificationBroker either for itself or for a third party. By default, a broker does not inform a third consumer of a subscription made for him.

So that an attacker can not abuse this mechanism, the placing consumer must authenticate himself to the broker. If this does not happen, the broker should reject the subscription in principle.

In the case of a successful subscription, the broker also has to return either aURI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ??or via WS-Resource a message about the placement made. With this information, the consumer can check the status of his subscription. Also this answer is to be authenticated in each case.

A subscription is placed once by a Notification Consumer and usually lasts until the same consumer deletes it from the Notification Broker. In an existing subscription, the broker does not inform the consumer whether a previously placed subscription still exists. For the consumer, therefore, it is unclear whether a broker only stops responding because there is no data for messages (notification) or because there is no longer any subscription.
