#M 5.127 Securing the SAP Internet Connection Framework (ICF)
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The Internet Connection Framework (ICF) of an SAP system allows HTTP-based access to functions of the ABAP stack. In addition, the ICF also supports the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP). Various services can be addressed. The services are arranged hierarchically in a file system-like tree structure. The HTTP access path (URL path share) is determined by the path in the tree. The transaction SICF is used for the administration of the ICF.

The following recommendations should be considered in the context of the ICF.

Information on SAP documentation can be found in M 2.346 Using the SAP documentation.
