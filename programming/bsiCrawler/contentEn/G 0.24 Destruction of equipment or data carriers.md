#G 0.24 Destruction of equipment or data carriers
Outsiders, but also internal dwellers, can try out different devices (revenge, benevolence, frustration), devices, accessories, documents and other data carriers (eg DVDs, USB sticks) or something similar. The destruction of data carriers or IT systems can result in significant downtime for business processes.

Negligence, improper use, as well as untrained handling can cause damage to devices and data carriers that could be detrimental to the operation of the IT system.

There is also the danger that the destruction will result in the loss of important information that can not or only with great effort be reconstructed.



## Examples 
* Inside a company, an inside desk used its knowledge that a key server is sensitive to overheating, blocking the slots for the power adapter with a hidden object behind the server. Two days later, the hard disk in the server suffered a temperature-related defect and the server failed for several days.
* One employee had been so annoyed with the system's repeated shutdown that he was ranting out his anger at his workstation. Hereby the hard disk was so badly damaged by footfalls against the computer, that it became useless. The data stored here could only partially be reconstructed by a backup from the previous day.
* Damping coffee cups or moisture penetrating the flower can cause short circuits in an IT system.
