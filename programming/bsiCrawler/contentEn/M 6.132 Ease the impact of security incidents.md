Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

In addition to effectively analyzing the causes of a security incident, it is also important to mitigate the damage resulting from this security incident. The direct effects of the security incident must be immediately recognized, assessed and mitigated so that the damage can not reach a high, very high or existentially threatening level. This requires that security management has sufficient information and an overview of the relationships between IT and business processes, as well as the IT systems, IT applications and other resources required. For example, this information can come from a structural analysis, protection needs assessment, and business impact analysis. Only in this way can reliable statements about the consequences and possible damage be made.

Often, it is easier to analyze a security incident if the affected IT systems or sites are isolated, thereby reducing the risk that the damage will spread to unaffected areas.

Sometimes the decisions have to be taken that the containment of the damage over the enlightenment has priority. For this reason, worst case considerations should be considered for selected security incident scenarios.
