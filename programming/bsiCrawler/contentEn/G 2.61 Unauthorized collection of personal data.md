When management systems are used, a lot of log data also accumulates within the scope of the normal procedure, which as a rule is automatically generated and evaluated. This applies in particular to the areas of network and system monitoring. Without detailed logging of the system activities it is esz. B. also not possible to detect security breaches. However, a requirement in the context of the monitoring is also the clear assignment of certain accesses to users. However, the monitored user activities must be logged personally. As a rule, the management strategy determines, across organizational boundaries and in consultation with the data protection officer, which user activities are to be monitored for security reasons. Hereby the concerned users are to be informed accordingly. However, compliance with the guidelines set by the management strategy must be checked as part of the system revision. It is also possible that the management system creates temporary log files as part of a regular function. stored in the low-protected area for temporary files. The log files are then potentially accessible, at least for the time of their existence, and may also contain user information.
