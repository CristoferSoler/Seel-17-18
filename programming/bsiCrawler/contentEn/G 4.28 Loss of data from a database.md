#G 4.28 Loss of data from a database
A loss of data from a database can be caused in many ways. This can be due to unwanted data manipulation (eg, accidental deletion of data), loss of database corruption, such as database corruption. B. extend as a result of the exhaustion of a storage medium, to targeted attacks.

Each storage medium can only record a limited amount of data. This also applies to a database, which has to resort to the permanent storage of its data on a physical storage medium. If this is exhausted, it can lead to a collapse of the database and a loss of data.

The capacity of the storage medium can be depleted for various reasons. Examples of this are errors in application programs, increased memory requirements of users or targeted attacks in which the available storage space is reduced in advance. B. to prevent logging.

As a result, regardless of the cause, the availability and completeness of the data are no longer guaranteed, and the following consequences can occur:

* Certain applications that rely on the data in the database may not work or may not be fully executed.
* The information content of the data as a whole is lost.
* There is a great deal of effort to recover damaged data.


Depending on the cause of the data loss, it may be difficult or even impossible to determine which data is no longer available. This can lead to further economic damage or security risks.
