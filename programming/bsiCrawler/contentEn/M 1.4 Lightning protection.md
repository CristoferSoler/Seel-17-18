#M 1.4 Lightning protection
Responsible for initiation: Head of Domestic Engineering

Responsible for implementation: building services

The direct effects of a lightning strike on a building (damage to the building structure, attic fire, etc.) can be prevented by installing a suitable lightning protection system. Beyond this external lightning protection, the internal lightning protection, the overvoltage protection, is almost mandatory. Because the external lightning protection does not protect the electrical equipment in the building. This is only possible with overvoltage protection (see M 1.25 overvoltage protection).



## Examples 
* Due to lightning, damage to IT equipment (PCs, servers, laser printers) in the German branch of a service company arose in the amount of about € 10,000,000. Due to this event, the building was equipped with external lightning protection without internal lightning protection (overvoltage protection). A renewed lightning strike resulted in damage in almost the same height despite external lightning protection.
