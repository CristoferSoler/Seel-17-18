#G 4.6 Voltage fluctuations / overvoltage / undervoltage
Fluctuations in the supply voltage can lead to malfunctions and damage to the IT. The fluctuations range from extremely short and small events that have little or no IT impact, to total failures or destructive overvoltages. The cause of this can be found in all areas of the power supply network, from the utility company's network to the circuit to which the equipment is connected.

Outside of the power supply network, it is also to be expected that any other electrically conductive networks (such as telephone connections, building control systems, water or gas pipes, etc.) will be subject to the introduction of overvoltages.
