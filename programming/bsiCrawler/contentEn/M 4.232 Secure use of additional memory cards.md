#M 4.232 Secure use of additional memory cards
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: users

Since mobile devices such as PDAs limit their available storage space, most models can be upgraded with external storage media. Widespread are hierf r memory cards, z. B.SD, MMC or Compact Flash Cards, which have the advantage of being able to be changed quickly. These cards do not require a battery for data storage, which eliminates loss of stored data due to lack of power. They are also useful for doing backups on the go, which is especially useful if a PDA user is often absent for a long time. As is generally the case with data backups, these must be stored securely. If the memory cards in the PDA or elsewhere can be left unattended, unauthorized persons can use them to read the data stored on them. This is done in no time with a laptop and a suitable adapter. If the memory card is then reset, it will not even leave any traces.

To protect the data on external memory cards, it is recommended to encode them with appropriate additional tools. As long as this is not the case, the memory cards should always be supervised while on the move.
