Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: users

Portable IT systems such as laptops, PDAs or mobile phones are always popular targets for thefts due to their design. Therefore, they must be kept safe even if they are in the supposed safe B ro. For this reason, of course, the measures described in block B 2.3 Room / Local Workplace must be observed. However, since a portable IT system is particularly easy to transport and hide, the device should be locked away outside of usage, such as being locked or chained in a closet or desk.
