#M 4.162 Secure configuration of Exchange servers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

After installing an Exchange server, the software must be configured securely, based on the requirements of the security concept. Before an administrator continues with the configuration after successfully installing Exchange, the general recommendations should be implemented here for administration.

During the actual configuration of the Exchange server, the following must be observed:



## Examples 
* The information store may only be accessed by the Microsoft Exchange system itself, for B.by packet filter.
* Direct database connections from other systems or clients are to be prevented by a security gateway (firewall).
