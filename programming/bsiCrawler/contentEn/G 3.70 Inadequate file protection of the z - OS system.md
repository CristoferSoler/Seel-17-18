#G 3.70 Inadequate file protection of the z / OS system
In the z / OS operating system, a security system such as RACF controls and monitors file access. Incorrect file protection administration may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to important files, such as: on operating system programs, on configuration files or on application data.

For example, RACF provides that user accounts can be given full privileges using special attributes (such as special or operations).

It should be noted that data that a user has read access to can always be copied from z / OS as well.

In this context, the danger G 3.16 Incorrect administration of access and access rights should be taken into account.



## Examples 
* The wage data files were created as a copy under the ID of an employee whose user account was defined in RACF with the Universal Access UPDATE attribute. All employees not only had read access, but could also modify the data.
