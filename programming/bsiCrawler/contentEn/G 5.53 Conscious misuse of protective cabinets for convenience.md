#G 5.53 Conscious misuse of protective cabinets for convenience
A frequently observed form of deliberate misuse of protective cabinets with mechanical code locks is that after closing a protective cabinet, the code must not be discarded in order not to have to re-enter the code when opening it. This misconduct reduces the protective value of the cabinet against unauthorized access, as this enables a third party to open the protective cabinet without knowledge of the code.

Also common is the fact that protective curtains are not closed when leaving the room for a short time in order to avoid having to open the cabinet after return. This also reduces the protection value against unauthorized access.
