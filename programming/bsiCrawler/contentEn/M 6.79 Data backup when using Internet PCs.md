Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Internet PCs can be used in different scenarios. On the one hand, Internet PCs can be installed on the Internet as an add-on to other access options, eg. If Internet access is available at the workstation PC, however, for security reasons no active content such as JavaScript can be executed. On the other hand, Internet PCs are in many cases the only way to use the World Wide Web, e-mail or other Internet services.

These application scenarios also result in different requirements for the availability of Internet PCs. High or very high availability requirements can be taken into account inter alia by redundant design of the Internet PC and the Internet connection. In case of a failure of the Internet PC, z. B. due to technical failure or a successful attack to be able to restore the system in a timely manner, a concept for the backup should definitely be created. A distinction must be made between the system, program and configuration files on the one hand and the application data on the other hand.



## Examples 
* for the first time, once the installation and configuration of the Internet PC is complete,
* any time operating system or software components have been installed, removed, or updated, such as by installing patches,
* every time there have been any significant or safety-related changes to the configuration.
