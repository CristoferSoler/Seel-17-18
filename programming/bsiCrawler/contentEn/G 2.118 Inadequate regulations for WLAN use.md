#G 2.118 Inadequate regulations for WLAN use
For an access point, no security mechanisms are usually activated in the default setting. If WLAN components are transferred into productive operation unsecured due to missing specifications, this poses a massive threat to the WLAN and IT systems connected to it. This is comparable to the risk of an unsecured Internet connection. Thus, if an employee connects an unauthorized or unsecured access point to an internal network of an institution due to lack of regulations on WLAN deployment, he undermines virtually all security measures taken, eg. B.the firewall for protection against unauthorized external access from the Internet.



## Examples 
* Without regular checks, it may be overlooked that foreign access points (including private access points) have been connected to the distribution system or directly to the LAN.
* If the WLAN protocols are not evaluated regularly, security incidents will not be detected in time. For example, a sudden increase in failed logon operations at the access point may indicate attempted attacks.
