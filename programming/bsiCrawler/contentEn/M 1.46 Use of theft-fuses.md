#M 1.46 Use of theft-fuses
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT

Anti-theft fuses are to be used wherever large values ??are to be protected or where other measures -z. For example, suitable access control to workplaces can not be implemented, as in the case of laptops in mobile use. Anti-theft security also makes sense where there is public access or where user turnover is very high. It should always be borne in mind that the values ??to be protected are only a small part of the replacement costs for the device, but that in laptops and similar IT systems, the value of the data stored on them must be taken into account.



## Examples 
* Equally: A key fits all device backups, department, etc. This has the advantage that the key management effort is lower. But it also has the disadvantage that many similar keys can be in circulation and that often no proof of evidence is possible in the event of damage.
* differentiated: Each device fuse has an individual key. This has the disadvantage that the expenditure for the key management is higher. But it has the advantage that there are fewer key duplicates.
* Main Key System: Each device backup has its own key, but can also be opened by a master key. This has the advantage that the expense for the key management is lower. But it has the disadvantage that such systems are more expensive to buy.
