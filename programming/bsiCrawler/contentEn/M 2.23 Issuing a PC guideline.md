#M 2.23 Issuing a PC guideline
Responsible for initiation: Public authorities / management, IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: user, IT manager

In order to promote the safe and proper use of information technology in larger companies or public authorities, a guideline should be drawn up in which it is mandatory to specify which boundary conditions must be observed and which security measures be taken. The policy should be made known to all users, for example in electronic form on an intranet server. Each new user must confirm the acknowledgment of the policy before being allowed to use the information technology. After major changes to the Directive or after 2 years at the latest, renewed confirmation is required.

The following is a rough outline of what content is useful for such a policy:



## Examples 
* Will the PC Directive be updated on a regular basis, at the latest after 2 years?
* Is it ensured that the PC Directive is available to all relevant parties?
* Is user awareness of the PC policy mandatory before using an organization's own IT system for the first time?
* When using teleworking: Does the PC Directive contain separate teleworking-specific regulations?
