#M 5.29 Occasional control of programmed destination addresses and protocols
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: fax officer

For programmable speed dial keys or destination memory, occasionally check to see if the fax you want matches the programmed fax number and if it is still needed. This prevents a foreign fax number entered by an unauthorized person from being used for a longer time instead of the correct number. In addition, any overlooked changes to the desired destination numbers are detected early.
