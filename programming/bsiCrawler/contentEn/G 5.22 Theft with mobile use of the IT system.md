#G 5.22 Theft with mobile use of the IT system
If an IT system is used on a mobile basis, new dangers arise that do not threaten stationary IT systems to the same extent. Mobile systems such as laptops are usually not used in a secure room. They are transported by car or public transport, left in stagnant rooms during breaks or placed in hotel rooms unguarded.

Due to these environmental conditions, such mobile IT systems are naturally exposed to a higher theft risk. The laptop included in the trunk of a car can also be stolen without this being the original target of the theft, because if the car is stolen, the laptop gets into the wrong hands.

Example:

* The managing director of a larger company was stolen the laptop on a business trip. The material loss was negligible, within a day a new device could be procured. More painful was the loss of important customer data stored on the laptop. There was no data backup from this information since it had only been collected during the business trip.
