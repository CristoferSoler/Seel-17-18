#G 5.102 sabotage
Sabotage refers to the willful manipulation or damage of property with the aim to harm the victim. Particularly attractive targets can be data centers or communication links between authorities and companies, since a relatively small amount of funds can be used to make a big impact.

The complex infrastructure of a data center can be selectively manipulated by targeted influencing of important components, if necessary by doors from outside, but above all by internal doors, in order to cause operational disturbances. Particularly threatened are not adequately protected building technology or communication infrastructure as well as central supply points, which may not be monitored either organisationally or technically, and which are easily and unobserved for external parties.



## Examples 
* In a large data center, the manipulation of the UPS led to a temporary total failure. The victim, he was diagnosed, had repeatedly manually switched the UPS to bypass and then manipulated the main power supply to the building. The total failure - four cases in total in three years - sometimes resulted in hardware damage twice. The business interruption lasted between 40 and 130 minutes.
