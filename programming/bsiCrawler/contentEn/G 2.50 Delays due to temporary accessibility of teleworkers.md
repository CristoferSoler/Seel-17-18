#G 2.50 Delays due to temporary accessibility of teleworkers
Usually, a teleworker has no fixed working hours at the home office. Only fixed times of accessibility are agreed. In the case of alternating telework, his working hours are distributed between the home and the workplace. If there is a short-term problem that information has to be obtained from the teleworker or information has to be handed over to the teleworker, delays may occur due to the difficult accessibility. Even sending the information via e-mail does not necessarily reduce the response time since it can not be guaranteed that the teleworker will read the e-mail in a timely manner.
