#M 4.171 Protection of the integrity of the index database of archive systems
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

The index database is especially important for the proper functioning of an archive system. It contains the references to all archived documents. Missing or damaged entries in the index database can mean that archived documents can not be retrieved or assigned to business processes at all or at great expense.

Therefore, for proper archive operation, the integrity of the index database must be ensured and verifiable. For integrity assurance, the following recommendations should be considered:



## Examples 
* Is the integrity of the index database of archive systems ensured and verifiable?
* Is there a regular backup of the index database of the archive system?
* Is there a regular check to see if the index database backups are recoverable?
* Is the index database redundant for medium and large archives?
* Are archives with high data volumes containing the mirrored database parts in different fire segments?
