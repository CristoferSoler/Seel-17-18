#G 4.44 Failure of Novell eDirectory
Failure of an eDirectory system or parts of it may result from technical failure due to hardware or software problems. As a consequence, the data held in the directory may temporarily become inaccessible, neither to eDirectory users nor to any network applications accessing the eDirectory. In extreme cases, data loss can occur.

As a result, business processes can be disrupted and the internal workflow can be hindered, as a result of the many functions of eDirectory and the strong integration into the organization, this can also lead to loss of productivity.

If replicas of the failed system parts are functional, the access is still possible, but under certain circumstances - depending on the network topology - with reduced performance.

Status: as of 2005
