#M 4.382 Selection and Checking of OpenLDAP Installation Packages
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Depending on the infrastructure used, it must be decided whether OpenLDAP will be installed from a source code or binary package. If an operating system distribution is used, it often also includes OpenLDAP as a binary package. This offers the advantage that dependencies on other software packages are usually resolved automatically and additional packages are additionally installed. In any case, a suitable current version must be selected, procured and their authenticity checked (see also M 4.177 Ensuring the Integrity and Authenticity of Software Packages). The selection and source of the software to be installed should be documented as well as the software integrity check process.



## Examples 
* Is the source of the OpenLDAP installation packages documented and an integrity check carried out?
* Is it ensured that only releases or stable releases are used in production environments?
