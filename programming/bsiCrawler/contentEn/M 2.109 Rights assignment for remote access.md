#M 2.109 Rights assignment for remote access
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

External access to an agency or company network must be limited to the required extent with regard to the rights granted. In addition to the requirements described in M 2.8 granting of access rights, it must be taken into consideration that granting rights for remote access is even more restrictive.

For example, a teleworker does not necessarily have to have access rights to directories containing software.

The remote access rights should be regularly checked for their necessity and timeliness.
