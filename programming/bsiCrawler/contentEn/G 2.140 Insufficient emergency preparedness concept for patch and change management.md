#G 2.140 Insufficient emergency preparedness concept for patch and change management
Patch and change management contributes to the technical implementation of information security in an institution. The IT systems used by this process are generally considered to be critical to IT operations. These include, for example, the central servers for the distribution of patches and changes, the databases with the current configurations of the IT systems and the backup servers for the creation of recovery points. If, for example, the server distributes the patches and changes, any critical updates that may appear can no longer be timely recorded.

Furthermore, missing data backups of the current configurations of IT systems can mean that in an emergency it is no longer possible to ensure that important IT components can be restored to their original state as quickly as possible.



## Examples 
* In order to support patch and change management, an enterprise uses an application that periodically places recovery points on a backup server. In the event of an emergency, when a system is to be restored from the backup server, it turns out that the system has not been able to take backups for some time because the disk has run out of space but nobody responds to the system's error messages Has. As a result, the restoration could initially only be carried out with an outdated software version, on which a few more security patches had to be installed.
