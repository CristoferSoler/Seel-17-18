#G 5.195 Exploit vulnerabilities in backend applications
In general, an XML transport container can be used to convey remote procedure calls to backend applications so that their functions are usable. However, opening the systems for remote use can create significant security risks that, in the worst case scenario, allow the entire IT system to be taken over. In particular, legacy systems often contain serious security holes that attackers can easily exploit. For example, these systems are susceptible to buffer overflow attacks.
