#G 2.99 Insufficient or incorrect configuration of the zSeries system environment
The zSeries architecture resource offering allows multiple production and test systems to run on a single physical machine. This results in a high risk potential because a faulty delineation of the zSeries system environments may allow unwanted access to external resources.



## Examples 
* In LPAR operation it is possible to configure the disks of a z / OS operating system so that they can be used by all z / OS systems of the computer (by configuring corresponding subchannel addresses via the Host Configuration Definition process) ). Associated with this is the risk that data separation between the LPARs is no longer guaranteed.
* It is possible to put LPAR1 disks on another LPAR2 Online. The data of the new disk is then available at the LPAR2 and can be edited according to the RACF definitions of this LPAR2. If the RACF definitions of LPAR2 are weaker than those of LPAR1, the data may be manipulated or read without authorization.
