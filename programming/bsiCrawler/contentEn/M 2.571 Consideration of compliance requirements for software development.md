#M 2.571 Consideration of compliance requirements for software development
Responsible for Initiation: Requirements Manager

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Requirements Manager

When developing software and using the software developed, care must be taken that no legal or normative conditions are violated. For example, there are significant legal and financial consequences if copyrighted program parts, libraries or graphics are used carelessly.

At least the following aspects should be checked for both the development tools used and the software product developed:

* Violation of laws or contracts
* Non-compliance with standards
* Violation of software used against license terms
* Infringement of patent rights
* Imitation of designs
* personality rights


All employees should be sensitized in order to identify in good time if compliance requirements are violated. Furthermore, it must be ensured that as much as possible of all infringements can already be established during the development phase and that they do not reach the productive system. When breaches become known, measures must be taken immediately and the development of the software must be adapted to the relevant conditions.
