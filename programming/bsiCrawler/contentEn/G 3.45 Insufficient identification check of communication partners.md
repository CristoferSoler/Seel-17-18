#G 3.45 Insufficient identification check of communication partners
In personal conversations, on the phone or in emails, many people are willing to divulge much more information than they would in writing or in a larger group. In this case, the communication partner frequently implicitly expects that the conversation or e-mail content will be treated confidentially. In addition, there is a tendency not to question the identity of the communication partner, as this is perceived as rude. This also applies to further inquiries about the reason for the call or the client (I work for the XY-Bank and need some detailed information on their income situation.). Such behaviors are also exploited in social engineering (see also G 5.42 Social Engineering).
