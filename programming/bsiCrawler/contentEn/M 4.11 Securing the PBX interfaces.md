#M 4.11 Securing the PBX interfaces
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, TK-Anlagenverantwortlicher

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The interfaces of a PBX, through which administration activities can be carried out, are worthy points. They should therefore be specially secured. Any unused or unsecured interfaces may be manipulated by unauthorized persons, for example with the aid of a laptop. The password protection on a telecommunications workstation or PC gateway would be ineffective in such a case. The goal is therefore to prevent this, but at least to make the attempt recognizable. For this reason, the interfaces used should be well screwed and possibly additionally sealed. Unused interfaces can be secured by screwed and sealed end caps.
