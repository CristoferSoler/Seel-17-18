Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

In order to decide in a well-founded way which storage solution is appropriate for the respective application, the technical fundamentals of different techniques have to be examined in detail and their effects on their possible use in the institution examined. The basis for the decision must be documented comprehensibly.



## Examples 
* When planning the storage solution, have the possibilities and limits of the different types of storage solutions been made transparent to the responsible persons of the institution?
* Have the decision criteria for the selection of a suitable storage solution been comprehensibly documented?
* Is the decision for the selection of the storage solution comprehensibly documented?
