#G 3.4 Inadmissible cable connections
If cable connections are made between IT systems or other technical components that are not intended, there is a risk that this will cause safety problems or malfunction. For example, due to such inadmissible cable connections, it is possible for unauthorized access to networks, systems, information or applications. Inadmissible cable connections can be used to transmit information in addition to or exclusively to incorrect recipients. The normal connection can be disrupted.

Inadmissible cable connections can have different causes and occurrences, for example:

* Technical defects
* Incorrect wiring of patch panels, patch panels or splice distributors
* Incorrect wiring of active network components
* Unauthorized connection of external IT systems to power outlets in the LAN


Inaccurate documentation and inadequate cable labeling often lead to accidental misplacement and make it more difficult to detect intentional misplacement.
