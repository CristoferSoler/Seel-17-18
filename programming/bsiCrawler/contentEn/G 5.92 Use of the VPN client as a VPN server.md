#G 5.92 Use of the VPN client as a VPN server
The software set up for VPN clients to dial into a remote access VPN often allows the client to act as a VPN server and receive incoming connections. As a result, there is a risk that unauthorized persons will attempt to connect to the VPN client and access the LAN via it.

If an attacker succeeds in overcoming the VPN authentication mechanism, he can also access the data of the VPN client. For example, an attacker could log in to the client without authorization by successfully retrieving or trying passwords, or by using non-password protected user accounts or guest passwords with standard passwords on the client. Depending on the type of connection of the VPN client to the corporate or authority LAN, the attacker can also access internal resources.
