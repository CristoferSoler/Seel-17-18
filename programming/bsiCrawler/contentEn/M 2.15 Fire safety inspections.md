#M 2.15 Fire safety inspections
Responsible for initiation: Head of Domestic Engineering, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: fire protection officer

When constructing and using buildings, all applicable fire protection regulations must be observed. These are codified by DIn and VDE standards and supplemented by building supervision regulations (see also M 1.6 Compliance with fire protection regulations).

Experience shows that after the start of use in daily operation, these regulations are handled more and more negligently - up to complete ignorance. Some examples:

* Escape routes are blocked, eg. By furniture and paper supplies.
* Fire compartment doors and smoke control doors are kept open by wedges.
* Admissible fire loads are exceeded by increasing cable quantities or changed uses.
* Fire barriers are opened and / or damaged during work and not properly restored.
* Smoke alarms near smoking corners are intentionally disabled.


Fire safety inspections should be announced once or twice a year or without notice.

Since the actions of employees are usually determined not by willful intent but by operational necessity or convenience, it can not be a sense of fire safety inspection to find and punish torture. Rather, the found defects should give rise to the immediate remedying of the conditions and their causes.
