#M 4.450 Securing communication in web services
Responsible for initiation: Responsible for the individual applications, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

Since the communication with web services can not always be internal, but can also be done externally via foreign networks and other participating agencies, it must be ensured that the data is transmitted over a secure channel. The aim is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. In order to secure communication in web services, different methods and standards can be applied, which can be divided into two basic strategies:

* Transport Based encryption and
* Message-based encryption.




## Examples 
* Server Authentication: The server authenticates itself to the web service client based on a cryptographic certificate.
* Client Authentication: In addition to the server, the client also authenticates itself to the server using a machine-specific certificate.
* User Authentication: The client-side authentication can also be done with user-related certificates and at the same time be used for the authentication of the respective user.
