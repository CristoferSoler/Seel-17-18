#M 2.84 Decision and development of the installation instructions for standard software
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: Procurement, Head of Department, Head of IT

After completion of all tests, the test results must be presented to the procuring entity. The decision for a product now has to be made by the purchasing department with the participation of the heads of the technical department and the IT department on the basis of the test results and the resulting price / performance ratio. In particular, the degree of fulfillment of the individual products must be compared to the catalog of requirements in relation to the purchase price. In addition, additional functions of the products, which were not listed in the catalog of requirements, but nevertheless make sense for the use, should be taken into account in the decision.



## Examples 
* With the product the drivers X, Y and Z (screen, printer, mouse, network) have to be installed in order to create a work environment that is acceptable to the user (screen flicker-free, reasonable print preparation, etc.).
* Those settings where individual functions have the highest processing speed should be specified, unless other criteria such as security speak against it (the size of the paging files must be set to at least 10 MB, the Verification option is for data backup although verification requires extra time).
