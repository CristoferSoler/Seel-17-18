#M 2.308 Excerpt from buildings
Responsible for Initiation: Public Authority / Management, Head of Internal Service

Responsible for implementation: internal service, employees

If a building is partly or completely vacated due to an extract, the following points should be noted:

* In the run-up to the extract, an inventory of all things relevant to information security (hardware, software, data carriers, folders, documents, etc.) is to be prepared.
* Every employee must be informed in writing about the items he is responsible for. This avoids that an employee takes good care of his own things, things for the alleged someone else is responsible, but remain lying.
* Old equipment, data carriers, etc., which are no longer required, must be disposed of according to measure M 2.13 before disposal. Proper disposal of valuable equipment must be disposed of. Under no circumstances may old equipment simply be left behind, even if the landlord, tenant or buyer wants their further use or promises to dispose of it.
* After completing the excerpt, all rooms must be checked to ensure that no safety-critical items have actually been left behind. Often things are forgotten, especially in remote storage areas such as cellars and attics. All items of business use must be collected, removed and, if necessary, subsequently disposed of safely.


The recommendations of M 2.177 Safety in case of changes should be taken into account.
