Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

With Windows Vista, Microsoft has introduced several security mechanisms to protect the integrity of critical system resources and protect the integrity of user data. These security mechanisms include the Windows Integrity Mechanism (WIM), Integrity Level (IL), Internet Explorer Protected Mode, Windows Resource Protection (WRP), Trusted Installer, and Windows Resource Prs Fung (sfc.exe). Which security mechanisms are to be used for integrity protection must be determined depending on the protection requirements.
