#G 5.206 Reverse engineering
Reverse Engineering (Re-Engineering) attempts to extract the design elements from a completed system by analyzing the structures, states, and behaviors. This can be hardware and software items.

The first step in systematic hardware reverse engineering is to get basic information about the target system, its components, and internal boards. Then functions, timing and signal paths are analyzed. Subsequently, the structure of the component is analyzed by means of physical processing, as described, for example, in G 5.203 Physical intervention in an embedded system. By means of a scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope or scanning probe microscope and special chemicals, material transitions, structure sizes, number of layers and p / n-doped zones can be visualized. Thus, each layer of a chip can be detected bit by bit and the transistors, coils, resistors, capacitors and lines can be structured and documented by means of special software and the circuit diagram can be verified.

For software reverse engineering an attacker must first have access to the machine code. With the aid of a disassembler, he can translate machine code back into assembly code and use a decompiler to transfer it into a more understandable pseudocode.
