* Missing or inadequate organizational regulations at the receiver may result in delayed processing of a received e-mail.
* Missing or inadequate organizational regulations at the sender can result in the fact that the data can not be delivered on schedule.
* If the data is not described well enough when exchanging data about groupware applications, it is often not clear to other users who posted or sent them, what information they contain, whether they are still up-to-date or what purpose they serve ,
* An employee of a federal agency has forwarded all e-mails from his office box to his private e-mail inbox.
