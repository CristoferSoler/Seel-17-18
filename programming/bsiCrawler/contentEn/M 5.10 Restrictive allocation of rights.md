#M 5.10 Restrictive allocation of rights
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Access rights to files stored on the hard disk of the network server must be assigned restrictively. Each user only has access rights to the files that he needs to perform his tasks. The access right itself is restricted to the required access type (see also M 2.5 Task distribution and separation of functions, M 2.7 assignment of access authorizations and M 2.8 assignment of access rights). For example, it is rarely necessary to assign a write permission to program files.

In most cases, the inheritance of rights to files in subdirectories may be accessed if an access right to the higher-level directory existed. As a result, access rights at the highest level (volume level) should be granted only to a very limited extent. In particular, when installing new software products, the assignment of rights must be rechecked.

If the PCs are equipped with floppy disk drives, special attention must be paid to restrictive rights assignment.

If the storage space of the network server is low, a limitation of the maximum storage capacity that a user may occupy on the network server can be set.
