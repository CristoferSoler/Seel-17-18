#M 4.43 Fax machine with automatic input enveloping
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: procurer

Fax machines with automatic input enveloping prevent incoming faxes from being unauthorized and unauthorized reading. Incoming faxes are bent in such a way that only the fax page remains visible and then sealed in a transparent envelope. After that, the envelope fills in a lockable compartment in the fax machine. Access to the envelopes is normally only available to the authorized person who holds the key to this subject. An unauthorized knowledge is possible before delivery of the fax only by violently opening the tray or tearing the welded envelope and is therefore at least noticed.
