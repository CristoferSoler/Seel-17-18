#M 4.217 Workload management for z / OS systems
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, specialist responsible

The management of resources in a Parallel Sysplex cluster (but also in a stand alone system) is handled by the Work Load Manager (WLM) component of the z / OS operating system. For the safety of the WLM use, the following instructions must be observed:



## Examples 
* Are the couple datasets required by z / OS systems for WLM protected by RACF profiles?
* Is the Modify command, which can dynamically change WLM options under z / OS, only available to authorized employees?
* Is the reset command protected so that only authorized employees can change WLM rules for running jobs in the z / OS system?
* Is access to the WLM application of the z / OS system protected by the RACF facility profile MVSADMIN.WLM.POLICY?
* Is the WLM application of the z / OS system only available to authorized employees?
* Are the permissions to change the z / OS WLM via the MVS command and the SDSF the same?
