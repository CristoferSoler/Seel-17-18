#M 4.33 Use of a virus search program for data carrier exchange and data transfer
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: users

In addition to the implementation instructions outlined in Measure M 2.3 Data Carrier Management, a virus check should be carried out immediately before and immediately after a data transfer and when exchanging or shipping diskettes or other data media (see Measure M 4.3 Use of virus protection programs). It is important to ensure that the virus search program used can detect macro viruses.

A sender verification protocol should be attached to the transmitted data medium or attached to a file sent electronically. It is recommended to keep this log as a copy. Based on this protocol, the recipient would have a first impression of the integrity of the transmitted data. However, this does not release from a renewed virus check. On the other hand, the sender can make plausible in the event of any complaints regarding the virus being infected with the data that he was unlikely to be affected.
