#M 4.219 License key management for z / OS software
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, responsible for the individual applications

Some software vendors use Activation Keys to control the use of their programs. These license keys often expire after certain times and must be renewed by the system operator. The following notes should be considered:



## Examples 
* Has a procedure been set up for the z / OS software to renew the license key in a timely manner?
* Are the terms of the license keys for the z / OS software documented?
* Is a warning issued by the z / OS software before a license expires?
