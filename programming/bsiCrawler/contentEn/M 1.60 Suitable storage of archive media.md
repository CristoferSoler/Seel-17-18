#M 1.60 Suitable storage of archive media
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

For the long-term use of archive media, especially the access protection as well as the climatic storage conditions have to be considered and their adherence monitored.

If archive media are kept in online access, ie in the archive system or in storage drives, no spatial separation between archive system and archive medium can be realized. For the suitable storage of archive media, the recommendations mentioned in M 1.59 Appropriate Installation of Storage and Archive Systems must be implemented.

If archive media are stored offline outside of the archive system, the measures described in the "B 2.5 data archive" block must be applied with special consideration to the requirements for air conditioning.



## Examples 
* The climatic and physical storage conditions for the archive media considered should be described in sufficient detail by the manufacturer (including the effects on the maximum service life). This information should be binding, as far as possible with a warranty statement from the manufacturer in compliance with the storage conditions.
