#G 4.72 Inconsistencies of databases in trivial database format under Samba
Samba files databases in Trivial Database (TDB) format in several directories. The files in these directories are very important for the proper operation of Samba. For example, the databases are used by the smbd processes to communicate with each other.

For these databases, Samba places very high demands on the underlying file system of the operating system in terms of performance and consistency. These requirements are not met by all file system / operating system combinations. This mainly affects older operating system and file system versions.

For example, in connection with Samba 3, Solaris has long had a serious scaling problem with locking in file systems. This issue occurred when about 600 users accessed the Samba server at the same time. Linux is also affected by similar problems. Some older versions of the ReiserFS file system also had difficulties interacting with Samba.

Failure to ensure that the operating system / file system combination used for Samba TDB files is appropriate during installation can result in severe performance issues or database inconsistency.
