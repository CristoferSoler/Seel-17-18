#M 2.494 Appropriate selection of components for the infrastructure of a Lotus Notes / Domino environment
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In particular, the new Notes client based on Eclipse technology (standard client, also called full client), but also the server components, require significantly more system resources than the components of the Lotus Notes / Domino platform before version 8. This is an upgrade to consider the versions as of 8.0. The existing manufacturer-specific specifications for procuring hardware for servers and clients on which Domino and Notes components are to be used must therefore be checked with regard to the new requirements, and the consequence may be the existing IT equipment adjust accordingly.

The decision to continue to use the proprietary Notes client (Basic Client) for end users can help to avoid performance and security issues (or major changes to the client infrastructure). New Domino server services, such as presence and instant messaging, also raise new security requirements that may affect the configuration of existing security infrastructure components, such as firewalls and IDS / IPS, or provide new security infrastructure components to secure these services are suitable. It is therefore necessary to coordinate with the operators of the operational security infrastructure and to adapt the requirements for the procurement and operation of security components in the Lotus Notes / Domino environment in advance. The components of the security infrastructure that should be considered include:

* Security Gateways,
* network-based systems for attack detection and avoidance (NIDS / NIPS),
* server-side systems for attack detection and prevention (HIDS / HIPS),
* server-side malware protection components,
* client-side personal firewalls,
* client-side components for malware protection and client-side HIDS (often bundled as a client-side security suite),
* Content security solutions (including appliances),
* Solutions to prevent sensitive data leaks (Data Loss Prevention or DLP solutions).


Prior to any release changes to the Lotus Domino environment and any significant changes in the use of the Domino services (eg, new services release), it should be aligned with the Lotus Notes / Domino security infrastructure components.
