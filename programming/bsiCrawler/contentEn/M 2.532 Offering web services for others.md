#M 2.532 Offering web services for others
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: sales, contract management

Web services can be deployed in a variety of ways. They can either be sold as a finished solution (operation by the consumer itself) or provided as a service (operation by the provider). When operating through a vendor, all relevant modalities of cooperation with the web service consumer must be contractually regulated and appropriate service level agreements (SLAs) agreed, for example contact persons, reaction times, control over the data, services, design of the security measures (see M 2.533 Contractual aspects in the provision of web services).

The following aspects have to be taken into account when running web services for third parties:



## Examples 
* contractual questions
* content / technical questions
* the notification and correction of faults as well as the alarm in case of an emergency
* the communication and treatment of security incidents
* the transmission or receipt of the agreed reports on key performance indicators, security-relevant events and changes to the systems and services.
