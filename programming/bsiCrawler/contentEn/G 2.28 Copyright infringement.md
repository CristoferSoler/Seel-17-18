#G 2.28 Copyright infringement
The use of unlicensed software may constitute a copyright infringement and may result in both civil and criminal penalties.

Authorities and companies in which piracy is used can be subject to compensation from the copyright owner in the event of organizational neglect, regardless of the form of guilt (intent or negligence).



## Examples 
* A large number of user interfaces were used in a company without the necessary licenses being acquired. The costs for the required additional licensing and the damages to the copyright owner amounted to a multiple of the license fees.
* In a company software is installed, whose license key is valid only for certain versions. If a new version of this software is installed without the license conditions being checked, this can impair the functionality of the software or even have civil or criminal consequences.
* The installation of software was not released and controlled in a company through a company-internal change process. Each department installed the software it needed on its own. Since no one has compared the number of installed instances with the number of licenses purchased, the number of purchased licenses has been partially exceeded or partially exceeded. The former may result in recourse claims and criminal proceedings by the manufacturer of the software against the company. The latter means that existing resources are not used reasonably.
