#M 4.373 Disabling unneeded hardware on Mac OS X
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

All non-Mac OS X devices and interfaces should be disabled. If, for example, webcams or microphones are not allowed in a company or agency, the corresponding kernel extension (kext) can be deleted to make it difficult to access the hardware and prevent it from being eavesdropped.

The kexts are in the following directory:

/ System / Library / Extensions

Then, execute the following command to update the folder change date. This deletes the extension cache and reloads it.

sudo touch / System / Library / Extensions

Before the kernel extensions are safely deleted from the recycle bin to prevent easy recovery, the data should be backed up, such as to a network drive. This copy should be placed in a secure location and accessible only to administrators.

Even if a kext has been removed to prevent access to the appropriate hardware, the software may have been replaced by a newer version, for example after an Apple software update. Therefore, after a system update, check that the kexts are still cleared. Any changes to Mac OS X affecting the kexts should be documented where appropriate.

If removal of the kernel extension is not considered sufficiently secure, it is possible to physically remove the corresponding hardware components.
