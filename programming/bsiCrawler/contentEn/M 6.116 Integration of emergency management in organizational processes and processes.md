#M 6.116 Integration of emergency management in organizational processes and processes
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: Government / company management, emergency officer

Especially in larger institutions there is often already a comprehensive risk, security and crisis management. Operational risks, including IT risks, are an integral part of risk management and security management. Residual risks that exist despite provisioning are covered by the crisis management.

Emergency management considers all risks that lead to an interruption or failure of critical business processes. Thus, in emergency management, there are many overlaps with both risk management, security management and crisis management. Therefore, the methods for the management of risks in the field of emergency management should be coordinated with the established methods. It is important that work instructions or service agreements from different areas of an institution should not contradict each other.



## Examples 
* Is it ensured that aspects of emergency management are taken into account in all business processes of the institution?
* Are the processes, specifications and responsibilities in the emergency management coordinated with the risk management, security management and crisis management (as far as such management systems are present in the institution)?
