#G 1.14 Data loss due to strong light
Typical discs with optical storage media are CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD + R, DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and MO. Information is both laser applied and read, only in the MO is magnetically written and optically read. The data carriers described in this way are sensitive to strong light, in particular in the UV range, so that the proximity to such light sources should be avoided.

Depending on the strength and duration of the radiation, this leads to more or less large data losses. This is particularly critical for files that, due to their internal formatting, become completely useless due to minor changes (eg PostScript files, databases or encrypted files).

Examples of strong light sources are:

* Sunlight (especially on cloud-free summer days or in high altitudes),
* Halogen lamps,
* special fluorescent lamps.


Recent research has shown that the adverse effects of sunlight or other sources of UV light vary depending on the type of optical storage media. For commercially reproduced CD / DVD-ROMs, these can be considered as minor. For write-once media (CD-R, DVD-R, DVD + R) direct sunlight is detrimental over an extended period of time as it can alter the optical properties of the recording layer. Light has minimal effects on rewritable optical storage media such as CD / DVD-RW. For all media, most of the damage is from the heat of direct sunlight.
