#G 2.38 Missing or inadequate activation of database security mechanisms
Each standard database software usually provides a set of security mechanisms that can be used to protect the data from unauthorized access or the like. However, they are not necessarily automatically active, but usually have to be activated manually by the database administrator. If this is not used, neither the confidentiality nor the integrity of the data can be guaranteed. In this case, it is then usually not possible to detect and log such protection violations. The loss or the manipulation of data to the destruction of the database itself can be the result.
