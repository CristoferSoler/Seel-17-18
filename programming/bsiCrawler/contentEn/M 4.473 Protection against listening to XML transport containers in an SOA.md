#M 4.473 Protection against listening to XML transport containers in an SOA
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, IT manager, user

When sensitive data is transmitted within a service-oriented architecture (SOA), appropriate encryption methods must be used to protect it. These encode either the entire message or only certain elements as required, for example with XML Encryption (XMLENC to W3C).

It must be ensured that the type of encryption used (eg encryption of the whole message, a sub-element or the content of an XML element) also corresponds to the desired confidentiality protection.

In addition, care must be taken to ensure that generated messages only contain as much meta-information as necessary so that no attack points are offered to a potential attacker.
