#M 4.37 Block specific sender fax numbers
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: fax officer, fax post office

So that certain fax transmissions can not block your own fax machine, eg. overloaded by special fax actions of advertising agencies, a blocking of certain sender fax numbers may be realized.

Some modern fax machines (Group 4) are capable of evaluating the transmitted station number and refusing to receive faxes of dialed numbers. This also applies to some fax servers, provided they are connected to the ISDN network. In addition, the fax sender identification (CSID Call Subscriber ID) can also be used for the evaluation. The disadvantage, however, is that the fax sender can suppress the call number transmission and manipulate the transmitted telephone number as well as the sender ID.

Another possibility is that the telephone network operator is charged a closed user group is set up when the receiver and transmitter are connected to digital exchanges. This option is sometimes also offered by modern PBX systems (see also module B 3.401 PBX).
