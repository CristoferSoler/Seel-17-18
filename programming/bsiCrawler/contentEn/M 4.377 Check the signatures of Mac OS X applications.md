#M 4.377 Check the signatures of Mac OS X applications
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Since Mac OS X 10.5, every executable operating system component is digitally signed by Apple. Third party manufacturers are also encouraged to sign their own programs. If a signed program is changed in any way, for example by malicious software, the signature becomes invalid. If a new program is used, its signature must therefore be checked. If no signature information is available, the program should at least be checked with a virus protection program. To verify the validity of a signature, Apple uses a public-key infrastructure, similar to HTTPS web pages. The administrators should be trained in using the codesign command in order to subject each new program to a one-time signature check.

Whether a program has a valid signature can be checked with the following command line command:

codesign --verify --verbose /path/to_file/filename.app

If it is a valid signature, the file corresponds to the original sold by the manufacturer and has not been changed. Thus, with a signature check a possible manipulation on the transmission path can be excluded.

Signatures are also used to uniquely recognize programs. This ensures that these programs have the appropriate Parental Control, Firewall, and Keyring settings.
