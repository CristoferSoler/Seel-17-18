#G 3.2 Negligent destruction of device or data
Negligence as well as untrained handling can lead to damage to devices and data that could be detrimental to the operation of the IT system. This is also possible due to improper use of IT applications, resulting in erroneous results or inadvertently changing or destroying data. Careless use of a single deletion command can erase entire file structures.



## Examples 
* Users who turn off the computer due to error messages instead of properly stopping any running applications or consulting a specialist can cause serious integrity errors in data records.
* Shaking coffee cups or moisture penetrating the flower can cause short circuits in an IT system.
* In a z / OS system, a system programmer had the authority to call the ICKDSF program to format disks. When he urgently needed a hard drive to do his job, he chose a free hard drive from the existing pool, but gave a wrong address due to a typo. He just read the reply in the system log quickly and answered it immediately. The formatting of a previously used hard disk was released and important production data was destroyed.
* A user who has made a habit of executing the delete command rm under Unix without the parameter for the security queries (-i), or even completely eliminating the security queries with -f, risks in high degree of accidental deletion of files.
