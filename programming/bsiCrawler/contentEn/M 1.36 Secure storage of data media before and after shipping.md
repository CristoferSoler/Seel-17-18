#M 1.36 Secure storage of data media before and after shipping
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: user, post office

Before sending a data carrier, you must ensure that there is sufficient access protection for the period between the storage of the data on the data carrier and the transport. Described volumes should be retained in a way that only authorized users can access, whether they are analog or digital. If the data to be transmitted are confidential, the data carriers on which they are located must be stored in suitable containers (cupboard, safe) until they are transported. The persons responsible for the transport or for the delivery (eg post office) are to be informed about proper and safe storage and handling of the data carriers.
