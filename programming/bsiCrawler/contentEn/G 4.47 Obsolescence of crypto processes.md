#G 4.47 Obsolescence of crypto processes
The reliability of cryptosystems is directly linked to the ongoing development of computational power of IT systems, the development of newer algorithms, and research in the field of cryptanalysis. Increasing the performance of IT systems can potentially compromise cryptoalgorithms or key sets that are considered secure in the future.

As a result, there is a risk that, in the case of compromising Kryptoverfahren or crypto keys

* encrypted data can be decrypted without authorization
* Unauthorized documents can be provided with a technically valid signature, so that then
* Authentic, signed documents can no longer be distinguished from falsified ones.
