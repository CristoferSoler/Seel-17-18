#G 3.37 Unproductive search times
The internet offers millions of information pages, documents and files. To navigate in this huge information offer a simple cross-linking technique is used. It allows a quick change to further information pages, which in turn contain new cross-references to other pages. Jumping over cross-references from one information page to another is called surfing and can lead to very long search times.

In many organizations, Internet services have been introduced without concrete exploration of their goals and expected impacts. The training and support for the users are often not sufficient, so that it comes to unproductive search times in the diverse range of the Internet. The cost of these queries is often unknown to either the users or the person in charge. After consulting a management consultancy, avoidable personnel and communication costs in the tens of millions of dollars per year arise through surfing as well as unnecessary and lengthy research on the Internet.
