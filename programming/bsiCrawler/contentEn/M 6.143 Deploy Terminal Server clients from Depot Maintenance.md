#M 6.143 Deploy Terminal Server clients from Depot Maintenance
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If a terminal server client fails, the applications on the terminal server are no longer available to the affected user. Therefore, when using terminals without their own operating system (thin clients) replacement IT systems should be kept. To quickly replace defective IT systems, the required terminal software can be preinstalled and configured in the currently required version.

The amount of systems to be provided is to be oriented in a suitable manner to the number of workplaces and the expected cases. In harsh environments, such as heavy dirt or dust, and extreme temperatures, the lifetime of installed clients can be significantly reduced. Such boundary conditions are to be included in the calculation.

The removal of terminal server clients as a replacement system, as well as the provision of new systems should be documented.
