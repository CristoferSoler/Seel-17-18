#M 2.526 Planning the operation of the storage solution
Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

The permanent safe operation of a storage solution requires careful planning. In addition to the definition of the operator concept and the location of the storage solution, the operation of the storage solution must be organisationally regulated and documented. In order to support the operation, an operating manual should be prepared and regularly updated.

The essential topics for planning the operation of the memory solution are described in detail below.



## Examples 
* Have all necessary regulations, requirements and settings for the operation of the storage solution been documented?
* When was the operating documentation for the storage solution last updated?
* Are the selection and determination of the operator model as well as the associated decision criteria comprehensibly documented?
