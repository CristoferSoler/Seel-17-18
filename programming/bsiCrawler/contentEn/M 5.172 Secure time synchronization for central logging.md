#M 5.172 Secure time synchronization for central logging
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

During logging, events that have occurred must be assigned a current time in order to enable the evaluation in retrospect. It is important to ensure that all IT systems use the same time base. So that all systems are time-synchronized even in a large information network, a central Network Time Server is generally used. This provides the central time clock, for example via the Network Time Protocol (NTP) (see M 4.227 Use of a local NTP server for time synchronization). All other systems in the information network synchronize themselves via this external time clock.



## Examples 
* Is the system time of all IT systems in the information network synchronized in order to detect attacks on IT systems and applications or their malfunctions?
* Is it ensured that the date and time format of the log files is consistent?
