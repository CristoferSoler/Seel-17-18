#G 2.128 Missing or insufficient planning of the VPN deployment
If a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is not planned and constructed carefully, individual security gaps in the VPN can impair the security of all connected IT systems. This can even lead to an inadequately secured VPN connection compromising a connected business or company network.

Missing or inadequate planning can lead to a variety of problems:

* Due to the selection of an inappropriate encryption algorithm of the VPN connection, attackers or competitors may be able to obtain mission-critical information from an institution.
* The application of strong cryptographic procedures must be approved in certain countries. This can lead to legal consequences if ignored.
* There are no guaranteed terms for Internet-based VPNs. This can lead to problems with time-critical applications (for example, real-time machine controls).
* For example, if the bandwidth required was not properly addressed during planning, the transfer capacity of the VPN might be insufficient. This may limit or even prevent the use of applications that require the VPN channel.
* Expansion stages may not be implemented if no consideration has been given to possible extensions during the planning and design of the VPN.
* There may be complications in integrating the VPN endpoints into existing security gateways. These are often due to the need to make complex settings on the security gateway.
