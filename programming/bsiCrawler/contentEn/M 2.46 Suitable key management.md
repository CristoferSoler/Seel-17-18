#M 2.46 Suitable key management
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: specialist responsible, IT security officer

The use of cryptographic security mechanisms (eg encryption, digital signature) requires the confidential, integrity and authentic generation, distribution and installation of appropriate keys. Keys that have come to the attention of unauthorized persons, misappropriated in distribution or even originate from an uncontrolled source (this also applies to the key agreement between communication partners) can compromise the cryptographic security mechanism as well as qualitatively bad keys that have been generated improperly. Qualitatively good keys are usually created using suitable key generators (see below). For key management, the following points should be noted:



## Examples 
* so that disclosure of a key does not affect all procedures,
* because it may sometimes be necessary to pass the encryption key (substitution case),
* because there may be different cycles for the key change.
