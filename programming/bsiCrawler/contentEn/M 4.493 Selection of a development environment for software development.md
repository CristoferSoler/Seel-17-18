#M 4.493 Selection of a development environment for software development
Responsible for initiation: Head of Development

Responsible for implementation: Head of Procurement

A suitable development environment is needed to implement a software project. The selection is made primarily on the basis of the programming language intended for the project and on the basis of the planned application type. In addition, optional additional functions and the acquisition and operating costs should be taken into account.

In order to select a suitable development environment, it is recommended to compare the absolutely required and the optional desired criteria in tabular form with the available products. The selection criteria may be considered equivalent or weighted and include, for example:

* Supported programming languages
* Supported Operating Systems
* collaboration opportunities
* Project management features
* Refactoring
* acquisition cost
* maintenance costs
* Compatibility with existing development systems
* Compatibility with existing projects (if required)


If several products come into question after the objective comparison of different development environments, the decision can be concluded with a subjective comparison. In this case, selection criteria are to be observed which can not be symbolized by a concrete value, for example:

* usability
* Intuitivitt
* Trustworthiness of the manufacturer
