#G 2.171 Danger to given control objectives in the processing of personal data
Inadequate technical and organizational measures for the processing of personal data are the main risks

* Unauthorized access to data processing systems can be obtained
* Data processing systems can be used by unauthorized persons,
* Authorized persons can access data outside their access rights,
* personal data can be read, copied, altered or removed without authorization,
* personal data may be read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during the electronic transmission or during its transport or storage on data carriers,
* it is not possible to check and establish the places where the transfer of personal data by means of data transmission is intended,
* it is not possible to subsequently verify and determine whether and by whom personal data has been entered, changed or removed in data processing systems;
* personal data processed in the order can be processed contrary to the instructions of the client,
* personal data are not protected against accidental destruction or loss,
* it is not ensured that personal data collected for different purposes can be processed separately.




## Examples 
* For example, many IT maintainers believe that it would be sufficient to protect the PC with a customized BIOS password for stand-alone PCs that are used by one person with only one application. It is overlooked that the BIOS password protection can be bypassed in many cases with simple means and in a short time, so that personal data can be unnoticed noted or even falsified. This also means that PCs, especially portable devices, can be stolen very easily, and then the data, if not encrypted, can be read out and used abusively by programs of the operating system can.
* One problem repeatedly discovered during checks is that in the case of IT systems, access to the programs and data records is ensured by a user identification (user ID and password) and a specific user guidance (menu system, user-specific interface) is, but it z. For example, although required by law, it is not possible to determine subsequently which data has been entered into the data processing systems because they have been misinterpreted to integrate adequate logging when designing the systems.
* Triggered by discussions about reducing staffing costs and data processing costs, many users believe they can solve existing problems by relocating data processing outside the home, thereby relocating the data protection obligation to the contractor. Often, the data protection provisions contained in the Data Protection Act are overlooked on behalf of the contract, which require a clear contractual arrangement and continue to leave the responsibility, including control of the technical and organizational measures, with the client.
