#M 4.221 Parallel sysplex on z / OS
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, specialist responsible

A Parallel Sysplex cluster is a system composite of several z / OS systems that appear outwardly as one system. The z / OS systems can run on one or more LPARs (Logical Partitions). For synchronization all systems of this network are connected via a coupling facility. When using multiple LPARs, a so-called Timer Facility must be used to synchronize the system clock. For more information, see M .3.39 Introduction to the zSeries Platform. Parallel sysplex clusters are used when high availability and scalability requirements exist.

All z / OS systems of a parallel sysplex cluster are loaded from the same disk set. The individual z / OS operating systems are distinguished by individual system definitions.

When using Parallel Sysplex clusters, the following recommendations should be followed:



## Examples 
* Defining the Couple Datasets
* Switching between Primary and Backup Couple Dataset
* Enable a new CFRM policy
* Start the PATHIN or PATHOUT connection
* Changing the structure size (Structure Size)
* Rebuild the structure after structure errors
