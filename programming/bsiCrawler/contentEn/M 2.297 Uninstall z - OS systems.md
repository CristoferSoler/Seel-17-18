#M 2.297 Uninstall z / OS systems
Responsible for Initiation: Information Security Management, IT Leader

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If a z / OS system is no longer needed, it is not enough to simply switch off the system. When dismantling a z / OS system or a parallel sysplex, the following recommendations should be followed:



## Examples 
* When uninstalling a z / OS system, are all hard drives that contain sensitive data deleted so that their content can no longer be reproduced?
* Replacement of defective hard disks of a z / OS system at the manufacturer: Are there any contractual agreements for the destruction of the hard disks by the manufacturer?
* Is it ensured that all identifiers are deleted from uninstalled z / OS systems?
* When uninstalling z / OS systems, does the reporting process verify that definitions are removed and tables may need to be deleted?
