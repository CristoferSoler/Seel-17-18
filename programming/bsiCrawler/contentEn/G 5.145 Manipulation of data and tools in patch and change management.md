#G 5.145 Manipulation of data and tools in patch and change management
Patch and change management usually operates from a central location. Due to its exposed position, it is particularly vulnerable to attacks. If attackers were to succeed in taking over the servers involved, they would be able to distribute software versions manipulated through this central point simultaneously across a variety of IT systems.

Often further points of attack arise from the fact that these systems are operated by external partners (outsourcing). Maintenance attachments could also be set up that could allow attackers to gain access to the central server for distribution of patches and changes.



## Examples 
* If a patching and modification management tool downloads data from an Internet source without checking the authenticity of the Web page and securing the connection, there is a risk that an attacker could inject manipulated packets over this data stream might. This would give him access to the central system of change management and the patched systems.
* Attackers succeeded in a company, the central update server of a Linux distribution to take over. After that, they replaced important program packages with trojanized versions. Each user of the update server thus installed malware and thus access for the attackers on his computer.
