#M 2.108 Remote maintenance of the ISDN network switching elements
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The absence of remote maintenance is an effective way to prevent outsiders from manipulating ISDN-cards on ISDN routers and IT systems.

Remote maintenance should therefore be avoided as far as possible. If there are still reasons against the lack of remote maintenance, these must be documented comprehensibly.

For IT systems with ISDN card, check whether the communication software used offers remote control functionality. In this way, the IT system in question can be called via the public ISDN, the ISDN card takes the call and the caller operates the IT system as if it were on site. This functionality is to be deactivated.

In the case of ISDN routers, the remote maintenance should be deactivated via reserved bandwidths (or reserved ISDN telephone numbers), since a connection protected only by a password to the management information base of the router is usually created in which almost all configuration settings are made can be made.



## Examples 
* Is external access to the internal network limited to the required level?
* Are the remote access rights or activated features regularly checked for their necessity and timeliness?
