#G 5.49 Abuse of source routing
The misuse of the routing mechanism and protocol is a very simple protocol-based attack capability. In an IP packet, the way in which the packet should reach its destination or which the response packets should take is prescribed. However, the route description can be manipulated during the transmission, so that not the safe routes provided by the routing entries are used (eg via the firewall), but other uncontrolled paths.
