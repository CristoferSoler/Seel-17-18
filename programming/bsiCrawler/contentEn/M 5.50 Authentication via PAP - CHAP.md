#M 5.50 Authentication via PAP / CHAP
Responsible for Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Many ISDN cards support the point-to-point protocol (RFC 1661) communication after establishing an ISDN dial-up connection. Authentication protocols such as the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) are also offered within this Internet standard (RFC 1994). If the ISDN card used offers these functionalities, the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol should be used instead of the Password Authentication Protocol for authentication, as with PAP the password used for authentication is transmitted in an unencrypted manner.

The passwords used in PAP or CHAP are generally not re-entered by the user at each authentication, but stored in the IT systems. In order for these procedures to be able to be put on again after a new installation, the required passwords should be noted down and stored securely (see M 2.22 Storing the password).



## Examples 
* If the ISDN card used supports PAP / CHAP: Is CHAP used for authentication and PAP is not used?
* Are the passwords used for PAP or CHAP securely stored?
