#G 5.40 Listening to rooms using a computer with microphone and camera
Many IT systems are now delivered with microphone and sometimes also with cameras. Microphone or camera of a networked computer can be used by those who have access rights to the corresponding device files. On Unix, for example, this is / dev / audio for the sound card or / dev / video for a camera, on Windows it is an entry in the registry. If these rights are not granted with care, and if other users than the intended users have access to them, the microphone or camera can be misused to listen to rooms or record meetings unnoticed.



## Examples 
* In March 2001, a TV business magazine showed how a room can be intercepted via the microphone of a laptop when the computer is connected to an ISDN telephone line. This was demonstrated with the laptop of a German politician. First, she was asked in a fake virus alert by e-mail to open a sent as an attachment protection program. However, this program contained a Trojan horse, which later made a connection to the outside via the ISDN line and transmitted the telephone number. Afterwards, the computer could be called from the outside without the user being visually aware of it or acoustically informed. Then the built-in microphone in the laptop was activated via the open connection and the sounds were transmitted outside the office.
