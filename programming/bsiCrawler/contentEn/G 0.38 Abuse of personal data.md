#G 0.38 Abuse of personal data
Personal data is almost always very valuable information. Typical examples are details of the personal or material circumstances of a particular or identifiable natural person. If the protection of personal data is not adequately ensured, there is a risk that the person concerned may be adversely affected in his social position or in his economic circumstances.

Abuse of personal data may, for example, be the case if an institution collects too much personal data, has collected them without legal basis or consent, uses them for a purpose other than that permitted for the purpose of the collection, deletes personal data or makes them unauthorized passes.



## Examples 
* Personal data may only be processed for the purpose for which it was collected or first stored. It is therefore not permitted to use log files that record the logon and logoff of users to IT systems exclusively for access control for presence and behavior control.
* Persons who have access to personal data could pass them on without authorization. For example, an employee at a hotel reception may sell the credentials of guests to advertising companies.
