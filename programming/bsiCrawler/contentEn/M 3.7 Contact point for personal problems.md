#M 3.7 Contact point for personal problems
Responsible for initiation: Staff Council / Works Council, Head of Human Resources

Responsible for implementation: Human Resources, Staff Council / Works Council

For an unsatisfactory performance of a task, personal problems of an employee can often be the cause. For example, high debts, addictions and difficulties in the workplace (over / under stress, bullying) can be listed as problems. In many cases, helping a person to overcome these problems can be helpful if a trusted person is available. This contact person should both have an eye on the interests of the person concerned and offer concrete assistance as well as safeguard the interests of the company or authority and look for possible solutions together with the person concerned.

However, supervisors and colleagues must also be able to turn to this person of trust if repeated reminders by third parties have been made that indicate a diminished reliability. The confidant must then have the opportunity to contact the person concerned and offer help.

Such a post can be taken by staff council, works council, company doctors. The establishment of such a contact point is to be announced to all employees. External agencies are, for example, the counseling centers of the statutory health insurance funds.
