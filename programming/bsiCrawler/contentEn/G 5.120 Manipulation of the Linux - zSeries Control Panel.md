#G 5.120 Manipulation of the Linux / zSeries Control Panel
There are three different operating modes of Linux on zSeries possible:

* Linux Native on zSeries hardware
* Linux in a zSeries LPAR
* Linux under the carrier system z / VM


For more information about the operating modes of Linux on zSeries, see the M .3.41 Introduction to Linux and z / VM for zSeries systems.

In all three operating modes of Linux on zSeries, there are the threats described in block  B 3.102 Server under Unix.

Mainframe-specific threats when using Linux

In addition to the vulnerabilities described in block B 3.102 Server under Unix, the following security issues may exist when using Linux on zSeries mainframes:



## Examples 
* By accessing Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) features, employees can access hardware resources such as hardware resources. For example, assign hard disks to the Linux partition without authorization. This gives the Linux operating system access to the hardware resources.
* Access to the HMC (Hardware Management Console) allows manipulation such as starting, stopping and allocating resources to an LPAR. Similarly, this is described in  5.116 Manipulating the z / OS Control Panel for the z / OS Operating System. Similarly security is the access to SEs (Service Elements). The service element is a component of zSeries hardware that provides the same functionality as an HMC.
