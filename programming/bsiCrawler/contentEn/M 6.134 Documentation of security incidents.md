#M 6.134 Documentation of security incidents
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, IT security officer, IT manager

During the resolution of a security problem, all actions should be documented as detailed as possible, ideally standardized.

* to keep track of causes, effects and measures,
* in order to make the problems that have occurred comprehensible,
* in order to be able to remedy a mistake that can be made in the most expeditious implementation of countermeasures,
* to be able to clean up already known problems more quickly
* to close the security loopholes and to develop preventive measures and
* to gather evidence for possible prosecution.


Such a documentation does not only include a description of the actions carried out, including the dates of naming the persons involved, but also the log files of the affected IT systems.

The confidentiality of documents regarding security incidents must be adequately protected.

Incident management should ensure that the required information is entered into the respective documentation systems before the completion of the malfunction. For this, quality assurance requirements have to be defined in advance with the safety management.

For standardized documentation of a security incident, the form can be used in the IT Baseline Protection tools found on the BSI websites.
