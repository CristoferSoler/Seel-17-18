#G 4.14 Fading of special fax papers
For fax machines that use the thermal printing process, special paper must be used, on which often after a relatively short time the writing fades to illegibility or becomes illegible due to the paper being blackened. In addition, these papers may become so discolored upon contact with highlighters or adhesives that the text is no longer legible.

As of July 1999
