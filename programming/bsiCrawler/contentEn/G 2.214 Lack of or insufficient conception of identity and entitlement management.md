#G 2.214 Lack of or insufficient conception of identity and entitlement management
A prerequisite for the secure use of identity and authorization management is comprehensive planning and conception of how user IDs and their authorizations are to be created, changed and deleted.

For this purpose, the lifecycle of an identity must be organized and conceptually ensured that only permitted authorizations are assigned to the identity. In addition, the responsibilities, tasks and information paths must be defined as processes.

The following examples show that deficits can lead to damage in the case of a missing or inadequate conception:

* In the case of a missing or inadequate conception of the processes for identity and authorization management, it may happen that the responsible administrator does not receive any information about personnel changes. So it can happen that a user account of a departed employee is not deleted.
* There is also a risk that employees who are moved to a new department will retain their old and no longer required permissions, thereby accumulating extensive overall permissions over time.
