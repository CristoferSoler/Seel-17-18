#M 2.501 Privacy Management
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: Data Protection Officer, IT Security Officer

Data protection management refers to the processes that are necessary to ensure the implementation of the legal requirements of data protection in the planning, installation, operation and after-taking of information processing procedures. Data protection management is the overarching implementation of data protection in an organization or in large-scale proceedings. The following describes a sample process for data protection management, which can be seen as an example process and proposal. The process is based on the BSI standards 100-1 and 100-2 and is to be regarded as an integral part of the security process according to IT-Grundschutz, but can also be treated as a stand-alone process if the privacy aspect should be treated as a priority. It makes sense not to set up and operate this process for individual processes, but for the entire organization and all processes in which personal data is processed.
