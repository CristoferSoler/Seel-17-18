#G 5.19 Abuse of user rights
An abusive use is when you take advantage of legal or unlawful acquired opportunities in order to harm the system or its users.

In no small number of cases users have greater or greater access rights for system-technical reasons than they need for their work. These rights can be used to extract data, even if work instructions prohibit access.



## Examples 
* On many Unix systems, the file / etc / passwd is readable by any user, so that he can obtain information about personal data entered there. In addition, he can use dictionary attacks (see   5.18 Systematic Testing Passwords) to guess the encrypted passwords. If the group rights are too generous, especially with the system groups such as. B.root, bin, adm, news or daemon, is an abuse such. For example, changing or deleting foreign files is easily possible.
* A storage administrator responsible for managing the disk inz / OS systems was able to see customer files, thanks to the Operations attribute that he had received from the RACF administration to perform his work. He used this access right to make copies without permission.
