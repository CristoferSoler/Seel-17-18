#M 6.147 Restore system parameters when using Mac OS X
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

If a Mac OS X system does not start or problems with file readability occur, there are several ways to do it. Users and administrators should be aware of the procedures for restoring system parameters when using Mac OS X. To recover a backup created with Time Machine, the recommendations in M 6.146 Backup and Recovery of Mac OS X Clients must be followed. To find errors when using a client on Mac OS X, which prevent a normal operating system start, you can choose between different startup modes. Since some of these boot modes are only available if no EFI firmware password has been set, this must first be temporarily removed. The Mac OS X installation DVD has an application called Open Firmware Password Utility that can be used to reset the firmware password.
