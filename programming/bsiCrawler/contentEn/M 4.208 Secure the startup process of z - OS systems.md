#M 4.208 Secure the startup process of z / OS systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The boot process of a z / OS system starts with the IML (Initial Microcode Load) procedure, through the IPL (Initial ProgramLoad) sequence of a z / OS operating system, to the start of the individual system tasks. The following instructions should be observed for the boot process:



## Examples 
* Are the current IML and IPL parameters documented and known to operating personnel?
* Have an MVS master console and a backup console to control messages during the boot process of the z / OS system.
* Is a backup console defined in the z / OS system to which the master can be switched automatically if the normal master console is not available?
* Does a message at the end of the boot process indicate completion of the z / OS system boot process?
* Is there an up-to-date checklist that can be used to check the system status after the z / OS system starts up?
