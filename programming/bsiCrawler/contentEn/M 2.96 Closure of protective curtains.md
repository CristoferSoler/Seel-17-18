#M 2.96 Closure of protective curtains
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

In general, protective covers should be closed when not in use. If work requiring opening of the protective cabinet is interrupted, the protective cabinet must be closed even if the room is left for a short time. If mechanical code keys (payment combination locks) are used, they must be rejected each time after closing the door, ie they must be completed. For example, some manufacturers recommend four turns on a number combination lock. This ensures that the lock is actually closed again and, in addition, that no conclusions can be drawn about the combination.
