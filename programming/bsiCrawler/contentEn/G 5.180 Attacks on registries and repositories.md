#G 5.180 Attacks on registries and repositories
In a service-oriented architecture (SOA), meta-information is stored centrally in service directories (registries) and metadata stores (repositories). The information stored there includes service descriptions, interfaces and call parameters, but also service or security policies.

The repositories are implemented as databases or directory services with a defined interface for retrieving the information (usually perHTTP). If improperly implemented or insecure, the repositories can be manipulated by an attacker (for example, by injection attacks). In this way, the attacker can not only obtain information about the services offered and the security mechanisms used (see also G 5.184 Obtaining information about web services), but also change the provided service descriptions and policies or replace them with their own. This may allow it to redirect service calls or XML messages, or override designated security features.

By deleting or deleting metadata, an attacker can also compromise the functionality or usability of the offered web services (denial of service). Likewise, it is conceivable to attack the functionality of the SOA very effectively at a central point by means of a denial-of-service attack on the registry or the repository itself.
