#G 3.8 Incorrect use of IT systems
Incorrect or improper use of IT systems may compromise their security if it disregards or bypasses security measures.

For example, overprivileged rights, easy-to-guess passwords, insufficiently protected data carriers with backup copies, or unauthorized terminals in the event of temporary absence can lead to security incidents.

Similarly, erroneous operation ofIT systems or applications may accidentally erase or modify data. As a result, however, confidential information could also reach the public, for example if access rights are set incorrectly.
