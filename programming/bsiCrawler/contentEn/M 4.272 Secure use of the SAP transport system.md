#M 4.272 Secure use of the SAP transport system
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The SAP Transport System (TMS) imports new functionalities or changed objects into the ABAP stack. As this is fundamentally a risk, the transport system must be configured and used as securely as possible. The following aspects are therefore to be considered for the transport management system:

In general, persons who create, inspect, and perform transports must be familiar with the concepts and procedures of the SAP Transport Mechanism (Transport Organizer).



## Examples 
* Are the responsible persons familiar with the concepts and procedures of the SAP Transport Mechanism (Transport, Organizer, Transport Management System)?
* Is it ensured that only the authorized persons have access to the transport system from SAP?
* Is access to the transport directory of the SAP system restricted, including at operating system and network level?
* Are transport files of the SAP system protected against unauthorized knowledge and changes?
