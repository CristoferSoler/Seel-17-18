#G 5.68 Unauthorized access to the active network components
Active network components usually have a serial interface (RS-232) to which a terminal or a portable PC can be connected from the outside. This makes it possible to administer active network components locally.

With insufficiently secured interfaces, it is conceivable that attackers gain unauthorized access to the network component. Thus, after overcoming the local security mechanisms (eg the password), you may be able to carry out all administration activities.

By reading out the configuration of active network components, information about the topology, the security mechanisms and the use of a network that may require protection can be found out. Reading the configuration data is z. B. by connecting a terminal or a portable PC to the serial interface of the active network component, by accessing the active network component via the local network or by reading the data on a screen or display, if the active network component is currently administered or not is configured.
