#G 3.22 Incorrect change of registration
Windows operating systems provide the ability to customize the user environment of an IT system globally or individually for each user. This is typically done using the system policy editor gpedit.msc or the registry editors. NT-based versions of Windows use regedt32.exe, regedit.exe, regini.exe registry editors, reg.exe command-line tools, and PowerShell since Windows 7 to edit the registry.

The use of these programs should be done wisely by trained personnel only. Any change in the registration must be carried out with utmost care, because a system state can be established very quickly which no longer permits working with the IT system. In the worst case, the operating system must be reinstalled or certain hardware components must be reinitialized (by loading the appropriate drivers).

Under Windows NT-based versions, registry entries are protected by access rights. Nevertheless, by misconfiguration of access rights, a user may knowingly or unknowingly modify the registration in an unauthorized manner. Improper changes can lead to system damage, which could endanger the safety and / or the workability of the IT system and, in extreme cases, of the entire network.
