#G 3.115 Incorrect selection of relevant log data
Log data often provides vital information to an IT early warning system to detect IT security incidents. Selecting the relevant messages from the large number of different log events is a particular challenge.

Numerous reports have only informative character and distract from the really important messages. This is especially true if a central logging is used, since then numerous IT systems send their messages to the central logging server.

If too many log messages are selected, it is difficult to evaluate the amount of information and time required. Furthermore, there is a risk that log data may be discarded or overwritten if the memory or hard disk capacity of the log server is too small. In the event that too little or not enough relevant log messages are recorded, safety-critical incidents may go undetected. This problem often arises due to misconfigured filter functions of an IT early warning system.



## Examples 
* The Exchange Server of a company should be integrated into the IT early warning system and monitored. The main task of the early warning system is to record all e-mails transmitted via the Exchange server. The administrator must log SMTP transactions on the Exchange Server. However, because the Exchange Message Tracking on the server was not activated, the Exchange Server can not be reasonably monitored.
