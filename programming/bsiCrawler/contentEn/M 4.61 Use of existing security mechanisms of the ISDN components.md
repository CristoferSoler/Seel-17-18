#M 4.61 Use of existing security mechanisms of the ISDN components
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Are M 2.106 suitable ISDN cards in procurementISDN cards with security functionalities for the IT system or the router, such as

* Ability to authenticate P to PAP and CHAP (Password Authentication Protocol and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, RFC 1994),
* Use of encryption (symmetric / asymmetric) in hardware or software
* Possibility of evaluating CLIP call numbers (Calling Line Identification Presentation) for authentication,
* Possibility of leading a phone number table for performing a call-back and
* Possibility of logging unsuccessful connection setups (rejection due to incorrect telephone number or PAP / CHAP authentication),


If they have been procured, these should also be suitably used, as are the measures M 5.48 Authentication by means of CLIP / COLP, M 5.49 Callback based on CLIP / COLP, M 5.50 Authentication by means of PAP / CHAP and M 4.34 Use of encryption coding, checksums or digital signatures. The prerequisite for this is that all communication partners are equipped with ISDN cards that have the same level of security functionality as possible.
