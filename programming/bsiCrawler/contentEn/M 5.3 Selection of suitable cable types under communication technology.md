#M 5.3 Selection of suitable cable types under communication technology
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of Domestic Engineering, Planner

The selection of the cable from the point of view of communication technology is determined by the required transmission rate (this is also frequently called bandwidth, which, however, is not entirely correct) and the distance between the transmission devices. In addition, the structural conditions, ie. the routes and the environmental conditions under which the cables are laid and operated. Since these also affect the cable structure, they are also to be considered in the selection. Advantages and disadvantages are described below with regard to safety.

The transmission systems used today use electrical or optical interfaces for wired communication. Correspondingly, the cables have to provide as transmission medium metal conductors for the electrical transmission or plastic or glass optical fibers (LWL) - for the optical transmission.

In the following, copper and fiber optic cables are considered closer:



## Examples 
* the unshielded U / UTP,
* the unshielded with a total screen for all wire pairs (F / UTP or SF / UTP),
* the shielded, in which only the individual wire pairs are shielded (U / FTP) - formerly also referred to as pairs in metal foil (PiMf) - and
* the aforementioned structure with an additional overall shielding (F / UTP, S / FTP and SF / FTP).
