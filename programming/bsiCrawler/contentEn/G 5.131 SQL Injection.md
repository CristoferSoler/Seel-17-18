#G 5.131 SQL Injection
If an application accesses the data of a SQL database, commands are sent to the database in the form of SQL statements. If the application is vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker can manipulate the input data to modify or inject additional SQL statements that the application passes to and manipulates the database. In this way, as with direct database access, arbitrary SQL statements can be executed, thus bypassing security mechanisms of the application during data access.

An SQL injection can therefore B. have the following effects:

* unauthorized access to data,
* Generating, reading out, changing or deleting data,
* Executing operating system commands,
* Control over the database,
* Access to additional servers (eg HTTP-Get-Request or DNS-query).


The injection of the SQL statement is facilitated by an inadequate validation of input data within the application, which is incorporated directly into a dynamic database query in this form (see also G 4.84 Insufficient validation of input and output data in web applications and Web applications). Services).

The SQL injection is a special injection attack (see G 5.174 Injection attacks), which is directed exclusively against SQL databases. Thus, the basic procedure for injecting commands is also possible with other interpreters (eg LDAP injection, XML injection).
