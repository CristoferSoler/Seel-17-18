#M 6.107 Creation of backups for directory services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The backup of a directory service should be integrated into the global data protection concept of the institution.

To get consistent backups of directory inventory on a server, a special backup tool should be used. In addition to a full backup of the directory, the tools also offer the option of backing up only parts of the directory service. In order to archive or restore individual directory service objects, the full Distinguished Name of the object must be specified. To save the entire tree, the respective tree object must be specified. The schema can also be saved separately. To do this, the schema object must be selected. After all, parts of a directory service tree can also be backed up by selecting the corresponding container of the tree. All objects below this container will be saved.

Partition information can not be backed up with these backup tools. In case of recovery, the corresponding parts must be partitioned later. Therefore, the partitioning of the directory service must be documented in writing, so that it can be reconstructed manually after a system failure. For this purpose, printed copies of the tree structure and partitions should be made and regularly updated.
