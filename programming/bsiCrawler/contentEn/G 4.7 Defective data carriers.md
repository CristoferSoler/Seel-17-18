#G 4.7 Defective data carriers
Damage, errors or failures can occur with all types of data carriers. The problem arises when the information stored on the data carriers is not stored elsewhere and can not be reconstructed quickly and easily. Total losses in the damage of analog data media are less common than in digital ones. Unlike computers, people are able to read information out of half-shredded or torn paper documents without the need for elaborate tools.

Unfortunately, the failure or defect of individual digital data carriers due to technical defects or damage is not an isolated case. Affected are mass storage such as hard disks, tapes or cassette systems. Hard disks can be destroyed by the head crash of the read / write head, tapes or cassettes by direct mechanical action. CD-ROMs or DVDs can become unusable due to scratching of the surface.



## Examples 
* In a medium-sized company there was a strong dust development due to construction work. As a result, dust particles even reached the computer room and there into the hard disk of a server. As a result, there was a head crash and the destruction of data.
