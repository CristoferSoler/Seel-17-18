#G 4.66 Impairment of health and the environment through printers, copiers and multifunction devices
Although a great deal of information is stored digitally, often paper documents can not be dispensed with. Many people prefer to read or edit documents on paper rather than on the screen. Printers and copiers will therefore be indispensable tools for a long time to come. In their use, however, it can also lead to health impairments.

Laser printers and copiers usually use dry toner, which is transferred to the paper. The dusty toner contains not only the actual dye but also heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. This toner dust is not completely transferred to the paper, so that remnants of it can be distributed throughout the room. Even when replacing an almost empty toner cartridge with a full toner may leak. So the fine health-causing toner dust can be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. In addition, ozone is released on some devices during operation. However, modern devices have filters that reduce the release of ozone.

Frequently, central printers, copiers and multifunctional devices are used, which are accessible to a large number of users. These devices are often heavily used. Although the operating volume of modern equipment does not cause harm, working in the vicinity of the equipment is rarely efficient. This is especially true for appliances located next to workplaces and not in separate rooms.
