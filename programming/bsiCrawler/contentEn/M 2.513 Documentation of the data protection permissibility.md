#M 2.513 Documentation of the data protection permissibility
Responsible for Initiation: Data Protection Officer, IT Leader

Responsible for implementation: specialist responsible

Before software or hardware are used for the processing of personal data, they should be checked for their legal validity under the intended use. Depending on the IT system (eg non-networked PC or central data center), there will be very different requirements here. The test result should be documented. For data protection controls, such documentation is particularly important.

The operational or official representative for data protection (bDSB) must be informed in good time according to   4g para. 1BDSG on projects for the automated processing of personal data. He has to monitor the proper use of (existing and new) computer programs that are used to process personal data. For this reason, it is recommended to start the bDSB from the beginning, i. as part of the initial plans to involve. Only in this way can data-protection-related errors be avoided in the planning phase, which could be time-consuming and cost-intensive at a later date at a later date.
