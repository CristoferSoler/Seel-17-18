#M 2.572 Procurement of software development tools
Responsible for initiation: Head of Procurement, Head of Development

Responsible for implementation: procurer

In addition to the development environment, additional software development tools may be required, such as graphics programs or management tools. Likewise, additional devices may be required, for example chip card readers or graphics tablets.

Tools that are an active component of software development should be procured according to standardized, documented procedures that specify, among other things:

* Guidelines for selecting hardware and software
* Methods to identify and handle security vulnerabilities of procured hardware and software
* Requirements for acceptable software license terms
* Review and release process for purchased hardware and software


Procurement should be done by reviewing vendors and taking into account the existing security requirements of the particular application. Availability is an important selection criterion, especially for special hardware.

Furthermore, it must be taken into account whether the hardware and software procured may be used for software development and the disclosure of information created or processed therewith does not conflict with the manufacturer's license conditions.

External security audits and certifications of hardware and software reduce the likelihood of security issues. The procurement decision should be subject to quality assurance by staff who understand the safety requirements and can assess whether they are met.
