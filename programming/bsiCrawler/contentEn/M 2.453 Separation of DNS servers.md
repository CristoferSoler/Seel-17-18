#M 2.453 Separation of DNS servers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If it is decided not to continue to operate a DNS server, for example because the domain is being dissolved, there are a few points to be aware of when setting up a DNS server. Among other things, the rejection plan is intended to prevent references to defunct DNS servers from remaining in the domain namespace.



## Examples 
* Have the disks of the DNS server been safely deleted?
* Was the DNS server hardware properly disposed of?
* Has the registration been deleted in the case of a registered DNS server?
* Were all configurations cleared on the clients pointing to the DNS server that has been removed?
