#M 4.259 Secure use of ABAP stack user management
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The secure use of the ABAP stack user management is a prerequisite for system security, as it determines who has access to an SAP system in principle. At least the following aspects should be considered when using user administration. Depending on the application scenario, other topics must also be taken into account, which are determined by the specific requirements in the company or the authorities. There are also requirements to be observed, which result from legal provisions.

Notes on SAP documents for user administration in SAP systems can be found in M 2.346 Using the SAP documentation.
