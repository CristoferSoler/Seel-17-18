#G 3.12 Loss of data carriers during shipping
If data carriers are shipped in containers that are not particularly sturdy (envelopes or other packaging), there is a risk that the data carriers will be lost if the packaging is damaged, especially if only individual CDs or similar data carriers are sent become. There is also the risk of loss at the recipient, by post or by carelessness of a messenger. For example, if a CD is sent along with a cover letter in an envelope that is much larger than the CD, so when receiving the envelope, the internal CD can be overlooked and disposed of accidentally together with the seemingly empty envelope. Even if only a short cover letter is lost by post, this can already endanger an important appointment.

In addition, if the information on the media is not encrypted, it may cause them to fall into the wrong hands if lost.
