#G 2.59 Operation of undeclared components
As a rule, all components of a system administration network should be known. At the organizational level, it must be ensured that new components are logged on and released during system administration. By an automatic notification of the procuring entity or a corresponding request by the organizational unit operating the components.

Unregistered components pose a security risk because they are not integrated into organizational in-house processes and controls. On the one hand, this can lead to dangers for the users of the non-registered components (eg data loss because the system is not integrated in the data backup), but also to the dangers of other network components, eg. Weak points can arise due to unrecorded access points to the network if they are poorly secured or not at all protected against unauthorized access. Since such a component is not subject to the control of network management and / or system management, in particular misconfiguration of the local system can lead to a security hole.
