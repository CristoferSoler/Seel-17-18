## Examples 
* Collecting Events on a Central Windows System Since the release of Windows Server 2008, it is possible to collect copies of events on a central computer (see Planning section).
* New Numbering of Event IDs Typically, the security event identification numbers (IDs) have been changed by moving the numeric value to 4096, so the former Event 528 Successful Application has now been given the new ID 4634. This should be taken into account in existing evaluations of event IDs, for example by using own scripts.
