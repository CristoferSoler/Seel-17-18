Responsible for initiation: building services, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: building services, IT security officer

A measure can only work as well as it is actually implemented. Checks provide the simplest means of checking the implementation of measures and compliance with requirements and instructions.

The checks should not be used to find a person to punish them. The purpose of the checks should be, first and foremost, to remedy any identified negligence as soon as possible (close windows, keep records, etc.). Secondarily, causes for these negligence can be identified and possibly avoided in the future.

The check-ups should also be made during the service period and used to inform employees about the how and why of regulations. So they are considered by all parties more as an aid than a guarantor.
