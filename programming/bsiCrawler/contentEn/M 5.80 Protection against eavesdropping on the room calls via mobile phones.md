#M 5.80 Protection against eavesdropping on the room calls via mobile phones
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

If you want to rule out that room calls are being monitored via mobile phones, you must ensure that no mobile phone is taken into the room to be protected. If the security policy of an institution does not allow mobile phones to be brought along, it must be clearly indicated on all entrances. Without appropriate controls, a simple hint is usually ineffective.

It is not enough for protection to simply switch off mobile phones or bring them into standby or flight mode. If they are manipulated accordingly, they can be switched on unnoticed over the radio.



## Examples 
* Is it ensured that mobile phones are not used in sheltered rooms?
