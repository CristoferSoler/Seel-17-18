#M 4.18 Administrative and technical security of access to monitor and single-user mode
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

To prevent activating the monitor mode and booting to single-user mode, the following actions should be taken:

* If it is possible (depending on the Unix variant and the underlying hardware), a BIOS password must be assigned to protect the Unix server.


* When booting into single-user mode, the super-user password should be queried to make it difficult for unauthorized persons to access the Unix server.


* If keyboard locks are present, they should be used to protect the system console to prevent access to monitor mode.


This measure is supplemented by the provision M 4.21 Prevention of unauthorized acquisition of administrator rights.
