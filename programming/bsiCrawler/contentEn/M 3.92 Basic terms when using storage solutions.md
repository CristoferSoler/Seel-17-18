Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

Business processes in institutions today are for the most part infused with information technology. Important information such as communication data, contracts, advertising materials or design plans are in many cases available exclusively in digital form. For companies and authorities, this data is of great importance. As a result, the demands that institutions make of their storage solutions have steadily increased in the past. At the same time, new developments in the storage environment are expanding the possible deployment scenarios, but at the same time bringing new dangers. Careful planning is therefore becoming increasingly important in connection with the use of storage solutions.

A prerequisite for successful planning is, among other things, the common understanding of all those responsible for the basic terms needed for the use of storage solutions. Below are therefore explanations of terms from the storage environment that cover all relevant aspects.



## Examples 
* Front-end ports (Fiber Channel + Ethernet)
* Storage processor (s) and associated RAM
* Memory Cache
* Backend ports to the storage enclosures (SAS, FC)
