#M 5.28 Telephone reinsurance via the correct fax sender
Initiation Initiation: IT Security Officer, Supervisor

Responsible for implementation: users

In the case of important or unusual fax transmissions, consideration should be given to checking with the fax sender that the fax was sent by him and not falsified by a third party. This can be done easily by a telephone callback. The required telephone number is generally documented on the fax form, but should be verified as it could be fake.
