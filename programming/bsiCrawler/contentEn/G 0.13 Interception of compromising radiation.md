#G 0.13 Interception of compromising radiation
Electrical devices emit electromagnetic waves. For devices processing information (eg computers, screens, network couplers, printers), this radiation may also carry the information currently being processed. Such information-carrying radiation is called blo stellende or compromising radiation. For example, an attacker who is in a neighboring house or in a nearby parked vehicle may try to receive that radiation and reconstruct the processed information therefrom. The confidentiality of the information is thus called into question. One possible objective of such an attack is industrial espionage.

The limits of the Electromagnetic Compatibility Act (EMVG) are generally insufficient to prevent the interception of harmful radiation. If this risk can not be accepted, additional protective measures usually have to be taken.

Blooming radiation is not limited to electromagnetic waves. Also, sound waves, such as printers or keyboards, may provide useful information.

It should also be noted that harmful radiation in certain cases can also be caused or intensified by external manipulation of devices. If, for example, a device is irradiated with electromagnetic waves, it can happen that the reflected waves carry confidential information with them.
