Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT, supervisors

The security of the data stored on Windows systems depends to a large extent on the correct handling of the users with the security mechanisms of the Windows systems. In order to be able to use these effectively, users of Windows systems should be trained accordingly; a concept is necessary for this.



## Examples 
* Protection of files by access rights
* Inheritance of access rights
* Copy and move files
* Transfer of a file to a new owner
* Awareness of restrictions on the protection of files by access rights
* Users with administrative rights can bypass access rights.
* With direct access to the hardware (eg after removing a hard disk) access rights can be bypassed.
* Files are not protected during transport   over the network.
* Meaning, functionality and operation of the user account control (see M 4.340 Using the Windows User Account Control UAC as of Windows Vista) in case users come into contact with it.
