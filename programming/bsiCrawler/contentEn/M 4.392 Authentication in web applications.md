#M 4.392 Authentication in web applications
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Administrator

If a web application or parts of it are to be used exclusively by a limited group of users, the user must authenticate himself to the application. For the authentication different methods can be used, which are described in the measures M 4.176 Selection of an authentication method for web offers and M 5.160 authentication against web servers.

When implementing authentication mechanisms for web applications, the following points should be taken into account.



## Examples 
* Does the web application use a centralized authentication component?
* Does the web application force the use of strong passwords?
* Do the web applications require an explicit user consent when using the Remember Me feature (opt-in)?
* Are critical functions of the web application protected by additional authentication?
* Does the web application set limits on failed logon attempts that make brute force attacks more difficult?
* Do all web application authentication methods offered (for example, password reset functions) meet the same level of security?
* Is the user of a web application promptly informed about the use of the offered password resetting function?
