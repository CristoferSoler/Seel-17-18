#M 4.279 Advanced security considerations for Windows Server 2003
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

For IT organizations with increased protection needs that use Windows Server 2003, additional measures to achieve such a level of protection are required. This not only means increasing the availability of the system as a whole (redundancy, high-availability clusters), but also targeted measures to increase the confidentiality and integrity of applications, data and network traffic. The measures may mean a restriction of functionality or interoperability. Therefore, a test environment should definitely be available to ensure the desired functionality.

The following explanations are cross-sectoral and not exhaustive. Depending on the role of the server, the deployment scenario and the corresponding threat situation, further precautions must be taken. The specific actions for Windows Server 2003 provide additional clues.



## Examples 
* For product activation: Is this only done online via a security gateway with a proxy server or is it switched to phone activation if necessary?
* Using Encrypted IP-Based Communication Connections: Is the increased administrative and technical effort aligned and documented with the organization's security policy?
* Have unused hardware ports and removable disk drives been removed or locked from Windows Server 2003?
