G 0.2 Unfavorable climatic conditions
========================================

Unfavorable climatic conditions such as heat, frost or high humidity can lead to various types of damage, such as malfunctions in technical components or damage to storage media. Frequent fluctuations in climatic conditions intensify this effect. Unfavorable climatic conditions can also cause people to stop working or even be injured or killed.

Every person and every technical device has a temperature range within which its normal functioning or proper function is guaranteed. If the ambient temperature exceeds the limits of this range upwards or downwards, this can lead to work interruptions, malfunctions or device failures.

For ventilation purposes, windows of server rooms are often opened without permission. In the transitional period (spring, autumn), this can lead to large temperature fluctuations that is exceeded by strong cooling, the permissible humidity.

Examples:

* High summer temperatures and insufficient cooling can cause IT equipment to experience temperature failures.
* Too much dust in IT systems can lead to heat buildup.
* Excessively high temperatures can cause magnetic media to be demagnetized.
