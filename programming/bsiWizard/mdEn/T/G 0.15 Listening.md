G 0.15 Listening
==============

Listening refers to targeted attacks on communication links, conversations, noise sources of all kinds, or IT systems for information gathering. This begins with the unnoticed, secretly eavesdropping on a conversation and extends to highly sophisticated complex attacks to intercept signals sent over radio or wire, e.g. B. with the help of antennas or sensors.

Not only because of the low detection risk is the wiretapping of lines or wireless connections a not insignificant threat to information security. Basically there are no tap-proof cables. Only the effort required to intercept distinguishes the cables. Whether a line is actually monitored is only detectable with high metrological effort.

Particularly unprotected is the unprotected transmission of authentication data in plain text protocols such as HTTP, FTP or Telnet, since these are easily analyzed automatically by the clear structuring of the data.

The decision to intercept information is essentially determined by the question whether the information is worth the technical or financial effort and the risk of discovery. The answer to this question depends very much on the individual possibilities and interests of the attacker.

Examples:

* In case of telephone calls, an attacker may not only be interested in listening to conversations. Also, the information that is transmitted in the signaling, can be abused by an attacker, z. B. if an incorrect setting in the terminal, the password is transmitted in plain text at logon.
* In the case of unprotected or insufficiently protected radio transmission (eg if a WLAN is only secured with WEP), an attacker can easily listen to the entire communication.
* Emails can be read through the web all the way through if they are not encrypted. Unencrypted e-mails should therefore not be compared with classic letters, but with postcards.
