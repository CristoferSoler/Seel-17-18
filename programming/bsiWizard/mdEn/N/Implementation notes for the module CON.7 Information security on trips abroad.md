### 1.1 Introduction

The number and extent of travel necessities has steadily increased in recent years as a result of globalization and the resulting increase in international networking between public authorities and companies. It is the entrainment of information technology, be it z. As the notebook, smartphone, tablet, removable hard disk or USB stick, as well as information in other papers or spiritual form on trips abroad in today's society has become absolutely essential to ensure the start of business activities outside the regular work environment. When traveling for business, especially when traveling abroad, there are a variety of information security threats and risks that do not exist in normal business operations.

Each trip is fundamentally different, because of the dependency on parameters, such as the purpose of the trip (business meeting, convention, congress, seminar), the duration of the journey and the destination, a new threat situation arises, also with regard to the protection of business-critical information.

### 1.2 Life cycle

For the best possible realization of information security on trips abroad, a number of measures have to be implemented, beginning with the planning and conception to the implementation up to the emergency preparedness. The steps taken and the actions that should be considered in each step are listed below.

** planning and conception **

A security policy must be established that sets out the information security framework for overseas travel and identifies predefined security measures, employee behavioral statements, and related issues (see CON.7.M1 Security Policy on Information Security on Foreign Travel).

In addition, a security approach to dealing with portable IT systems on foreign travel or teleworking should be developed and regularly reviewed, detailing all security requirements and measures in adequate detail.

**Implementation**

Responsibility for creating, implementing and implementing information security on overseas trips should lie with security management. In order to adequately implement the safety policy by business travelers, awareness training and training should be mandatory in order to improve the perceptions of all issues.

The various security requirements placed on information security during work abroad should therefore be carefully followed by all employees. The consideration of the established safety requirements as well as attentive employees allow the identification of security problems and the timely reaction to them in order to prevent or mitigate possible damages. Security problems and changes are detected in good time so that established security measures can be further developed or the travel scenarios adapted accordingly.

In addition to the organizational aspects of a trip abroad, technical measures must be taken and physical measures implemented. For this purpose, in particular the use of encryption / cryptography, the possibility of securely deleting data and information, as well as the security of communication via public or unknown Internet access, such. As hotspots to look at.

** Emergency Preparedness **

In the context of emergency preparedness, it should be ensured that security incidents are detected on international trips or reported promptly or escalated using the specified routes (see module DER.1 Detection of security incidents). The reported incidents should be assessed with regard to their relevance to emergency (see module DER.2.1 Treatment).
Appropriate measures should be taken to respond to emergencies when traveling abroad.

For further information, for example, for personal protection, the economic security module travel security can be used.

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the section "Information security on trips abroad".

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### CON.7.M1 Security Policy for Information Security on Foreign Travel

The security policy provides a comprehensible framework for the conception and implementation of information security for foreign travel. It documents the essential requirements and conditions that must be taken into account when traveling abroad in terms of information security.

The security policy on information security on trips abroad should include the following topics:

* a brief description of what the institution understands by information security when traveling abroad,
* the scope of information security on foreign travel,
* the place and purpose of information security on the journey for the institution,
* the core aspects of information security to be taken into account when traveling,
* the assumption of responsibility by the management of the institution and the ISB, which is additionally documented by the explicit approval with a signature,
* the assumption of responsibility and obligations by the traveling employee, this should be documented
* the commitment of the management level and ISB to conduct regular training and awareness-raising training for overseas employees,
* the reference to relevant laws, guidelines and regulations that have to be taken into account with regard to information security on trips abroad (eg data protection abroad, entry and exit regulations).
The following key aspects should typically be considered in the security policy:

* Duty to provide information on country-specific regulations, travel and environmental conditions
* Observation, analysis and evaluation of the risk and security situation of the destination
* Dealing with lost or stolen IT systems or information
* Regulations for conducting training and awareness-raising
* Handling of portable IT systems (eg storage, password, privacy protection, do not leave unattended open)
* Reasonable protection of portable IT systems (eg encryption, virus protection)
* Encryption, backup and protection of data and data carriers
* Secure and physical deletion of data and data carriers or documents
* Dialup with VPN access
* Dialing into foreign networks (into a secure or encrypted network, eg username, password)
* Security regulations for data exchange with external parties
* Authorization process for taking and collecting data
* 24/7 hotline for questions or loss reporting of portable IT systems
In addition, the inclusion of the security information security policy when traveling to the existing information security management system may optionally be considered.

The security policy for information security on trips abroad must be approved by the management in writing. It is to be announced to all internal employees who carry out a foreign activity. The announcement should be made in such a way that the importance of information security on trips abroad becomes clear to all employees.

#### CON.7.M2 Raising employee awareness of the security policy Information security on trips abroad [IT operations, data protection officer]
Security in general and information security on trips abroad in particular can not be done without attentive and well-trained staff. Therefore, training and awareness-raising is an integral part of employee preparation. Therefore, overseas employees should be continuously and adequately sensitized to information security when traveling abroad and receive regular training. In particular, they should be taught the dangers of inappropriate handling of information, improper destruction of data and data carriers, malicious software and insecure data exchange, as well as the limitations of the security measures deployed.

Similarly, users should be made aware of the need to protect mobile IT systems and the data on them. In the process, specific threats or corresponding measures should be demonstrated when using mobile IT systems. Users should also be informed about the type of information they may have during their stays abroad, eg. B. the notebook or smartphone may be processed.

Travelers are responsible for not creating opportunities for misuse of critical, intranet-internal information and data. For its part, the institution is responsible for creating the basis for the proper handling of portable IT systems or information on trips abroad.

Employees should be empowered and encouraged to seek expert advice in case of inconsistencies or to prevent loss or theft. In addition, employees should be made aware of the legal requirements of individual travel safety travel destinations. Here, the ISB is responsible for informing itself about legal requirements in the context of information security (eg data protection, IT security law) and sensitizing employees.

In order to achieve this, the employees must be given a plausible and comprehensible illustration of why and to what extent information security is important for the institution, especially on business trips. You must be aware of the hazards and effects of security incidents as well as the necessary measures and the relevant regulations in the security documents.

In order to sensitize employees for information security when traveling, they have to be contacted again and again in different ways and through different media. This can be done using already established ways and media, but also can be designed new. Suitable ways and media are z. To:

* Newsletter
* Flyer to take away
* Short instructions
* Video clips on selected sensitization topics
The following aspects should be prepared and observed by employees on trips abroad:

* Contents of applicable ** internal regulations ** for business trips abroad and overview of information to be protected, threats and measures for the security of information, with and without IT use.
* ** Workplace Environment **: ** ** Employees must instruct them to decide, prior to each mobile trip abroad, if their environment is suitable as a mobile workstation, especially with regard to information security.
* ** Prohibition of use of hardware and software ** that has not been released: All employees must be informed again before traveling abroad about the prohibition of the use of unreleased hardware and software.
* ** Malicious programs **: Safety instructions or regulations to be respected should be issued to employees who avoid or reduce infection of portable IT systems with malicious programs. However, if a portable IT system becomes infected with a malicious program, the incident must be immediately communicated to a central reporting office of the institution. Here central contact persons must be named and made known. In addition, compliance with anti-malware rules should be regularly and randomly checked.
* ** Password Usage **: Users should be instructed to use password protection passwords that are adequate in their complexity. In addition, these should put a special emphasis on the secrecy of their password. Passwords must be changed immediately as soon as they have become known or suspected of being unauthorized. Access to the institution's IT systems should be secured with multi-factor authentication.
* ** Prevention of unsecured network access **: Users may not use a public network or network access of foreign institutions (WLAN and LAN) directly or unsecured in order to access internal resources. Such accesses are generally considered untrustworthy.
* ** IT and data carrier transport **: Established rules for carrying portable IT systems and data media should be noted and implemented. In some cases, the high level of protection required for the confidentiality of information must also be taken into account. Therefore, mobile IT systems and media should be fully encrypted.
* ** Compulsory information on country-specific regulations, travel and environmental conditions **: Before employees travel, they should inform themselves about the current security situation as well as legal and regulatory requirements. Specific travel and safety information can be obtained from the German Foreign Office, see https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Laenderinformationen/SicherheitshinweiseA-Z-Laenderauswahlseite\_node.html. Information on security-related topics should be obtained by ISB and made available to employees.
* ** Communication with your own institution and business partners **: Institution-internal regulations should be made and lived for communication on the move (eg use of secured connections). Both e-mail and landline and mobile phones can be easily spied out, so any communication needs to be secured to pass on high-sensitive information with end-to-end encryption.
* ** Attention of employees during work abroad **: Regulations should be made regarding the behavior of employees abroad. In addition, employees should not talk to strangers about the purpose of their trip and their employer to protect business-critical information. Accordingly, an employee should become suspicious of unusually high demand on work or employer issues.
** Acceptance of gifts **: Accepting gifts is often difficult, as consideration is usually expected. Therefore, employees have to be informed about how to proceed in such cases.
* ** No use of gifts with digital storage **: Accepting or using gifts with digital storage is always considered extremely critical. Rules should also be defined for dealing with such situations. In general, it is recommended that no gifts with digital memory, such. B. USB sticks to accept and use.
It is important to carry out these sensitizations continuously and to repeat them regularly.
#### CON.7.M3 Identification of country-specific regulations, travel and environmental conditions [Human Resources Department]

Provisions for dealing with country-specific regulations, travel and environmental conditions should be defined in the security policy on information security on trips abroad. On the one hand, the ISB or the Human Resources Department must examine the respective applicable regulations of the individual countries and communicate the country-specific circumstances in the context of information security and personal security to the appropriate employees before they start a journey. On the other hand, travelers are also obliged to provide themselves with sufficient background knowledge about the destination and its specifics.

The prerequisite for this is that appropriate regulations for the exchange of information during stays abroad have been drawn up and communicated to all participants. The security policy on information security on trips abroad needs to be updated on a regular basis, especially if there is a need to adapt due to changing circumstances.

Environmental influences abroad, such as As a high humidity, heat, cold or dust, can also affect the functioning of electronic devices such as notebooks or smartphones. The HR department, ISB and employees should deal with the climatic conditions of the travel destination before departure and take protective measures to protect employees as well as accompanying information technology and information. Portable IT systems should be protected against special climatic conditions or environmental influences, such as: As moisture due to rain or splashing, be secured. Mobile IT systems should not be exposed to extremely low or high temperatures unless specifically designed. Both battery and display can be disturbed by extreme temperatures in their function or even destroyed, z. As if IT devices are left in cars, but this is not recommended because of the potential theft risk.

The respective applicable regulations of the individual countries should be examined in situ before each trip. Have existing regulations on the exchange of information been defined and announced? Should an adjustment be made here in situ? Are existing encryption types or communication methods suitable or secure?

In addition, the problem may arise that notebooks are used by business travelers in certain countries, such as: As the US, can be searched at the entry or exit. This aspect conflicts with the protection of confidential information from access by third parties. Because not only is it permissible for the US authorities to search through IT systems, they can also take them over and copy data. In addition, IT systems can be confiscated for up to a month, which can be a problem for travelers if they are limited or even prevented from carrying out their work. Therefore, the institution has to create regulations here that allow the protection of company-internal data. An example are corporate rules, in which passwords for accessing the entrained IT systems are sent only after successful entry, certain data is securely deleted before departure, or no sensitive data is stored on smartphones.

#### CON.7.M4 Using privacy screens [user]

In order to protect the display of notebooks, tablets or smartphones and thus the displayed internal data from prying eyes of others, the use of suitable privacy films is a tried and tested option. These cover the display of the device used and make it difficult to spy out information (so-called shoulder surfing).

#### CON.7.M5 Using Screen / Code Lock [User]
Using a screen / code lock prevents third parties from accessing data on mobile devices, such as mobile devices. B. notebooks or mobile phones can access. For this an appropriate code or a secure device password must be used.

The period after which a screen lock automatically activates due to a lack of user input should not fall below or exceed certain limits. The period should not be too tight, so that the screen lock does not start after a brief pause for thought. Under no circumstances may this period be too long so that the user's absence can not be exploited by third parties. A reasonable default is a 10-minute period for notebooks and 2 minutes for other mobile devices. The ISB should set the latency requirements that reflect the security requirements of each IT system and its environment of use. These requirements should be enforced as centrally as possible on the terminals, for example via group policies or an MDM.

#### CON.7.M6 Timely loss report [user, emergency officer]

Employees must report to their institution immediately if information, IT systems or data media have been lost or stolen. For this purpose, there must be clear reporting channels and contact persons within the institution. It is recommended, for. For example, set up an emergency hotline that can be reached 24 hours a day.

Laptops, smartphones, tablets, PDAs, and similar devices, as well as portable media such as USB sticks, can hold sensitive data that requires immediate action, such as:

* Access data such as passwords: All access data of the affected IT systems must be changed immediately.
* Information classified as confidential (eg, patient records): All affected areas (eg, department, customers, etc.) must be notified to take appropriate action.
* In addition, VPN access, machine or client certificates as well as computer and user accounts should also be blocked. If available, logon attempts or intrusion attempts should also be detected and prevented by appropriate monitoring.
If mobile devices with a wireless connection are lost, measures should be taken to block, delete and locate mobile devices. Most mobile device management solutions offer these features. Clear rules must be defined in advance and appropriate measures must be taken immediately in consultation with the user whose terminal device was lost (see SYS.3.2.2 Mobile Device Management).

If the missing notebook or smartphone reappears, it should be examined for possible tampering, eg. For example, if screws have been opened or seals removed, or if the weight has changed from the original state. If the user himself does not have the necessary options for this or if there is a suspicion of manipulation, the respective device should no longer be used and handed over to a specialist for further examination. There should be a clear regulation as to how to locate the device during the journey. For a mobile storage device, the requirement of CON.7.M9 Secure Mobile Media Handling should be applied to ensure there are no malicious programs or malicious software on the recovered media.

#### CON.7.M7 Secure Remote Access [IT Operations, Users]
Because mobile IT systems are often operated in unmanageable environments, remote access to the institution's network requires the use of special mechanisms, procedures and measures that can protect IT systems. In particular, mobile VPN clients are exposed to a particular danger, since they are physically very easy to attack (eg theft, manipulation). If a VPN client is compromised, there is a risk that this will also affect the security of the LAN.

For the secure operation of the mobile IT systems, they must be provided with a secure basic configuration (see blocks SYS.2.1 General Client and SYS.3.2 Mobile Device Management). For foreign travel the following specific points have to be considered:

* For the direct connection of mobile IT systems to the Internet, it is indispensable to protect them against attacks from the network by means of a restrictively configured personal firewall. The virus protection alone is not enough to ward off all expected attacks.
* It is also essential to keep the software of the IT systems up to date and to import the necessary security patches in a timely manner. It makes sense to check whether personal firewalls, other security programs and security patches on the laptop are up-to-date before accessing the production network.
* It is advisable to use automated tools to perform these checks automatically, so that in case of security deficiencies, access to the internal network can be rejected.
* The Internet application programs installed on the IT system, especially the browser and e-mail client, should be operated with secure settings.
For secure remote access of employees to the institutional network, a secure remote access via VPN must first be set up, see also NET.3.3 Virtual Private Networks. The VPN access must be cryptographically secured in order to prevent unauthorized listening between the terminal and the network of the institution.

A mobile IT system can easily fall into the wrong hands. The connection to the internal network (the tunnel structure) should therefore not be automated, but only after an authentication. Users must have adequate credentials to successfully authenticate themselves to both the terminal and the network.

In addition, communication via the VPN must be encrypted. For this, a key length appropriate to the current situation must be used. In addition, it must be ensured that established cryptographic algorithms are used, of which no security problems are known.

In addition, the following aspects must be considered for the use of the VPN:

* It must be regulated for which business processes and applications the respective VPN is used and which information may be communicated about it.
* It must be determined which services may be used only if secure remote access is available. For example, if remote access is available, do not allow services such as e-mail to pass by.
* It is to be determined, e.g. Based on their previous knowledge, which employees should receive which authorizations via the remote access.
* Suitable identification and authentication procedures for the use of VPN access must be defined.
* Responsibilities and reporting channels for the operation and use of VPN must be determined.
* It should be ensured that all cached authentication information that enables the establishment of a VPN will be deleted automatically after the end of VPN usage.
* For each VPN, it must be determined from where to which network may be accessed.
* Create a VPN security policy.
* Each VPN user must have a copy of the VPN policy or a leaflet with an overview of the most important security mechanisms.
* The policy for VPN usage needs to be explained to staff, for example during training sessions or awareness-raising events.
#### CON.7.M8 Secure Use of Public WLANs [User]

WLAN hotspots, such as those found in public places such as hotels, airports, exhibition halls, train stations, restaurants and convention centers, should always be considered as an insecure network, as it is difficult to assess the level of security that exists there from the outside. The user must be made aware that hotspots can not be classified as trustworthy.

The access of mobile IT systems to resources of the institution via publicly accessible WLANs should therefore only be possible via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or with comparable security.

Further information can be found in the following modules:

* NET.2.2 WLAN Usage (General)
* INF.10 Mobile workstation (for Wi-Fi hotspots)
* NET.3.3 Virtual Private Networks
For the use of public WLANs abroad the following regulations should be considered.

Unencrypted Wi-Fi hotspots should not be used if possible. WLAN hotspots should be used which require an encrypted login with user name and password. The credentials must be encrypted by the hotspot operator so that they can not be read in range of the wireless connection.

Regardless, the operator of a hotspot can read the traffic if it is not suitably encrypted or secured by a VPN.

For multiple wireless networks with similar names, care must be taken to select the correct wireless network. However, Wi-Fi hotspots can also be deliberately set up under familiar names of public wireless networks to attract users. Many terminals also automatically establish connections to, in particular, known networks.

Business-critical data may only be transferred via external hotspots if appropriate security measures and secure protocols are used. Access to the internal network of the institution may only be made via trusted connections. In addition, it should be regulated whether the validity of the hotspot certificates must be checked during authentication. It should be considered to use separate user accounts with a secure basic configuration and restrictive authorizations when using external hotspots on the own IT system. Under no circumstances may users with administrative privileges log in from a mobile client to external networks.

#### CON.7.M9 Secure Handling of Mobile Media [User]

Normal erase of data typically removes only the reference to the data, and the data itself remains in place until you reuse the used space. There are also technical artifacts that contain duplicates of at least some of the data.

If a secure encryption method is used for the data, it is usually sufficient to securely delete the key and all its copies. Thus, the encrypted data is still on the disk, but can not be decrypted with reasonable effort. It is therefore recommended that all data carriers (even of stationary computers) are always encrypted in order to simplify secure deletion. The administration of the keys has to be documented, especially the storage of recovery keys.
An adequate deletion for the normal protection requirement can be achieved by overwriting the entire data medium. With special software tools, the data carriers are overwritten one or more times with predetermined character sequences or random numbers. The volumes must be intact and continue to be usable even after overwriting.

For the higher protection requirement, the override procedure should consist of at least two passes and a verification of the overwrite operation. Random data is recommended as the data pattern. Another possibility is to use the data pattern (bit sequence) that is complementary to the first pass in the case of multiple overwrites on the second pass. To delete data carriers containing classified information (VS), only products recommended or approved by the BSI for the respective classification level may be used.

For some devices, such as BlackBerry and Apple, there is also no direct access to the built-in memory. Functions of the operating system must be used to delete the data. After deletion, if possible, manually verify that all data artifacts have been removed.

If sensitive data has been processed, data carriers should not be reused after deletion, but should be destroyed directly.

If a secure deletion or destruction is not possible, it is recommended to take the data carriers back to their own institution and dispose of them there in accordance with a regulated procedure.

The following sections describe the specific procedures for different devices and disks.

** Secure deletion of mobile hard drives and USB sticks **

In principle, mobile data carriers can be deleted much like built-in hard disks. If no computer is available with the deletion software, you can also boot from an external medium and use suitable software.

** With encryption **

If the mobile data carrier has been completely encrypted with a secure procedure or all data is stored in a securely encrypted container, it is sufficient to delete the key material safely.

As an accompanying measure, all copies of possible key material (eg recovery keys) should be deleted. For this documentation of the key management is helpful.

If it is unclear whether all copies of the key material have been deleted, or if the quality of the hard disk encryption implementation is unclear, the deletion should also be performed as described in the following sections.

All performed steps should be logged.

** Flash memory based media (USB stick, SSD) **

USB sticks generally do not provide any special commands for deleting or, in the case of SSDs, the quality of the implementation is often unclear. Therefore, flash memory-based media should be completely overwritten with a random pattern at least twice. Such media have more memory blocks than they provide. The amount of data and the override pattern are used here, in contrast to the hard disk, to cause the load distribution of the medium to overwrite all internal memory blocks.

Since the internal memory blocks can not be addressed directly from the outside, it can not be checked whether all memory blocks have been overwritten. However, an access to such data artefacts would only be possible for an attacker with great effort (desoldering of the building blocks, reconstruction of the data structures). For data with normal protection needs and confidential data, this approach is sufficient.

For unencrypted, strictly confidential data, we recommend that you physically destroy and dispose of the media after it has been deleted as described. Previously encrypted media can be reused for areas of the same classification after being deleted.
Media declared as defective should first be checked on at least one other system. If they can not be extinguished there, the medium should be physically destroyed and then disposed of, for example by a special disposal company.

All performed steps should be logged.

** Secure deletion of BlackBerry OS devices **

To safely erase all data on the BlackBerry, the Secure Wipe feature must be triggered. This is possible via the following ways:

* By the mobile device management tool BlackBerry Enterprise Service by the responsible administrators or by the self-service portal by the user himself.
* For an unlocked device in the app "Settings" select the menu item "Security and Privacy", then select the function "Security delete" and confirm the deletion by entering "blackberry".
* For a locked device, enter the wrong password multiple times.
In order to check the correct deletion, the device should thereafter be reactivated with a test user and checked whether there are still links, eg. B. can be found with the mail account of the original user.

If there is an increased need for protection, the BlackBerry can also be read out for verification with a forensic tool. In this case, the test user must have a valid Blackberry ID. It is recommended to set up your own e-mail address and to register a Blackberry ID.

Since the deletion is only triggered by the operating software of the device and full access to the built-in data memory is not possible, a complete verification is still not possible. Therefore, devices that handle sensitive data should be destroyed after secure deletion.

All performed steps should be logged.

** Secure deletion of iOS devices from Apple **

To safely delete all data on an iOS device, factory reset must be initiated by one of the following methods.

* By the user about the deletion function via the online platform icloud.com. To do this, the user must log in with the Apple ID under which the device was activated.
* By the responsible administrators of the used mobile device solution, which trigger the command to reset to the factory state (wipe).
* In the case of an unlocked device, select the menu item "General" in the "Settings" app, then select the function "Reset" and initialize the deletion by selecting "All settings".
* For a locked device, enter the wrong password 10 times.
In order to check the correct deletion, the device should thereafter be reactivated with a test user and checked whether there are still links z. B. can be found with the mail account of the original user.

With increased protection requirements, the iPhone or iPad can be read in addition to the verification with a forensics tool. In this case, the test user must have a valid Apple ID. It is recommended to set up your own e-mail address and to register an Apple ID via it.

Since the deletion is only triggered by the operating software of the device and full access to the built-in data memory is not possible, a complete verification is still not possible. Therefore, devices that handle sensitive data should be destroyed after the secure deletion.

All performed steps should be logged.

#### CON.7.M10 Encryption of portable IT systems and data carriers [user, IT operation]

In order to prevent that information worth protecting can be inspected by unauthorized third parties, it must be ensured before departure by the employee that all information worthy of protection is protected in accordance with the internal guidelines.
Mobile data carriers and clients should be encrypted according to internal procedures and regulations before departure, in order to protect sensitive data against unauthorized access. This is especially true for rewritable media. It is possible to encrypt volumes only partially. However, for ease of use, it is recommended that you encrypt the entire disk if it is not needed for a third-party data exchange. An encryption of the disk can be achieved either with software such. B. BitLocker from Microsoft or FileVault from Apple, or even with special hardware. For the decryption of clients, a cryptographic key is necessary, which should be used in the form of a separate chip card or a USB token. In this case, the user should keep the cryptographic key and the encrypted volume or client separate from each other.

In addition, it is important to take precautions against data loss in order to intercept malfunctions (power failure, abort of encryption) on the system side. In addition, the following requirements are useful:

* The encryption algorithm used should meet the requirements of the institution.
Key management must harmonize with the functions of the mobile IT system.
* The mobile IT system must securely manage the security-critical parameters such as keys. Thus, keys (even those that are no longer used) must never be left unprotected, ie readable or unencrypted. They must be kept separate from the encrypted device if possible.
When encrypting data, attention must be paid to existing legal regulations of the destination country. For example, country-specific laws regarding the issuing of passwords and the decryption of data must be observed.

#### CON.7.M11 Use of theft-fuses [user]

Anti-theft devices can be used wherever there is a need to protect large assets or where other measures can not be implemented, such as laptops in mobile use. Anti-theft backups are also useful where there is public traffic or where the turnover of users is very high. It should always be kept in mind that the values ​​to be protected are only a small part of the replacement cost of the device, but in laptops and similar IT systems, the value of the stored data must be taken into account.

** Prevent a Cold Boot Attack **

In areas that are not sufficiently protected against unauthorized access, for example, could be read by a "cold boot attack" of memory. The same applies to systems that have been put into a power-saving mode by Suspend to RAM.

In a cold boot attack, the memory chips are heavily cooled before the system is turned off. The memory content is retained for several minutes and can be read while using a suitable device.

Cold boot attacks can only be prevented if attackers have no way of accessing the memory of an active IT system without being disturbed. Access protection, such as a physically locked computer chassis, makes it difficult to open an IT system without authorization to cool and extend the memory, but it can not permanently prevent it. Therefore, an unused IT system should always be turned off if it is not in an access protected area.

** Types of theft-fuses **

Depending on the object to be protected, anti-theft fuses should not only equip the IT system itself, but also accessories.

The market offers a wide variety of theft security devices. These can first be divided into mechanical and electronic fuses.

** Mechanical Fuses **
The mechanical fuses include, but are not limited to, cable retainers, housing retainers (to protect the housing from opening), security panels, and security enclosures. There are hardware backups that prevent the theft of IT equipment, such as: By connecting the IT system to a desk. On the other hand, there are also a number of security mechanisms that are designed to prevent the case from being opened in order to prevent theft of parts or the manipulation of security-relevant settings such as the removal of security cards.

When purchasing mechanical fuses, it is important to choose a good lock that has a locking system that is tailored to the individual needs. Depending on the product, different locking systems are possible:

* concurrent: A key fits all device backups of an institution, department and so on. This has the advantage that the expense of key management is lower. But it also has the disadvantage that a lot of similar keys can be in circulation and that in case of damage often no evidence is possible.
* different closing: Each device fuse has an individual key. This has the disadvantage that the expense of key management is higher. But it has the advantage that there are fewer key duplicates.
* Master Key System: Each device backup has an individual key, but can also be opened by a master key. This has the advantage that the expense of key management is lower. But it has the disadvantage that such systems are more expensive to buy.
Most notebooks, but also many other devices, have a small opening marked with a chain or lock icon ("Kensington Lock"). This opening (approximately 3 x 7 mm) is located on the side or rear of the device. There is a wide range of cable retainers and other products that use this opening for securing devices.

In the case of cable fuses, a cable loop must then be placed around a solid object in the vicinity of the device, and the associated lock must be pulled through the resulting tab and closed.

For devices that do not have this opening or where it is not strong enough, there are backup products where a sturdy plate is glued to the device. At this then the security cable is attached.

** Electronic fuses **

In addition, there are electronic fuses, for example, trigger an acoustic deterrent alarm on the device itself, which should bring potential thieves to leave the device. Other security devices are z. As security devices (with EAS antennas or security labels) or even camera or video surveillance systems.

It should be noted that these fuses usually do not provide comprehensive protection and are available in different quality. In general, they protect against "takeaway" and less so against targeted theft. A good comparison are bicycle locks, which have a similar benefit balance.

When new IT equipment is purchased, care should be taken to ensure that these grommets are attached to the housing for attachment to other objects and that the enclosures are lockable.

#### CON.7.M12 Safe destruction of sensitive materials and documents [user]
Within your own institution, there are usually trained procedures on how to dispose of old or unusable data carriers and documents, but this is not possible when traveling. Therefore, before disposing of discarded media and documents, consider carefully whether they could contain sensitive information. If this is the case, the data carriers and documents must, in case of doubt, be taken back to their place of origin or back to their own institution. On site, as few as possible materials or documents worthy of protection should be produced.

File and data shredders ("shredders") in foreign institutions should be considered with caution, since it is not clear who is performing the disposal or how reliable this is.

It should also be noted that under certain circumstances experts can also recover valuable information from defective data carriers. Likewise, such data carriers must not simply be thrown away if data worthy of protection could still be found thereon.

If companies abroad are entrusted with the disposal of equipment worth protecting, they must be checked to see whether the disposal process is reliable.

It should provide the traveler with options for secure deletion while traveling or safe transportation to the company. This can be z. In form:

* providing equipment for travel,
* working with a local service provider,
* working with couriers,
* the use of institutional branches
be enabled.

The security policy must include rules on how employees should handle outdated data media and documents on the move.

As a general rule, data carriers should be protected against unauthorized access until they are disposed of or collected and protected over the entire transport route. Even if it is disposed of according to the appropriate security levels, data carriers should be securely deleted beforehand.

A DIN-compliant disposal of physical media, however, is difficult to obtain abroad. It is therefore recommended that documents and data carriers be taken back to their own institution and disposed of there in accordance with a regulated procedure.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures correspond to the state of the art in the field of "Information security on trips abroad".

#### CON.7.M13 Carrying of data and data carriers [IT operation, users]

The data on IT systems that are used outside of their own real estate, such as notebooks, mobile phones, tablets, mobile hard drives, exchange sticks and more, must be adequately protected by security measures. Above all, the transport of data carriers and IT components on foreign trips should be clearly regulated. These include the following rules:

* The IT systems must not be checked in as baggage, but must be carried by the traveler (as carry-on baggage).
* IT systems must always be kept secure. On business trips they should not be left unattended. In particular, they should not be left behind in vehicles.
* The security of access to the IT systems must be implemented with the prescribed security measures. B. by PINs or passwords.
* IT systems or data media that contain sensitive data should be encrypted as completely as possible. If IT systems enable easy-to-use encryption, it is recommended that these functions be used even if only less sensitive data is stored on the IT systems. The cryptographic keys should be kept separate from the encrypted device.
* It may be useful to use dedicated mobile IT systems for out-of-town assignments. The management, maintenance and transfer of such externally deployed IT systems should be regulated. For example, device pools can be set up for this purpose.
* It should be logged when and by whom which IT components are deployed outside the home and in which country they are located.
Before starting your journey, you should first check which internal data is not necessarily needed on the IT system. If it is not necessary to leave this data on the device, it should be deleted securely (see CON.7.M9 Secure handling of mobile data carriers). However, if there is a need to carry sensitive data with you, this should only be done in encrypted form.

Outside of the organization's own properties, employees are responsible for protecting the IT entrusted to them. These and the precautions to be taken are to be noted.

It should be specified in writing which mobile data carriers may be taken on trips abroad and which security measures must be taken into account (eg protection against malicious software, encryption of business-critical data, storage of mobile data carriers). Employees should know and comply with these regulations prior to departure.

It should be set

* which IT systems or data media may be taken outside the home,
* who is allowed to take IT systems or data carriers out of the house,
* which basic security measures must be observed (virus protection, encryption of sensitive data, storage, etc.).
The type and extent of security measures to be applied to externally deployed IT systems depends, on the one hand, on the protection requirements of the IT applications and data stored on them, and, on the other hand, on the security of the storage or storage locations.

** Storage of portable IT systems and sensitive information **

Users of portable IT systems should be advised to save them before traveling overseas. Users of mobile IT systems must take care to keep the devices safe outside of the institution. The same applies to information worthy of protection. Consequently, safety instructions are given, which must be observed in mobile use:

* Portable IT systems should not be stored unattended or unprotected. Even when leaving a foreign office, care should be taken to ensure that the IT systems and data carriers are not left unsecured. Therefore, either the room should be locked or the IT systems and data carriers should be taken along. When leaving the room, the device should be turned off or the access lock should be activated to prevent unauthorized access. Wherever other measures such as suitable access control can not be implemented, anti-theft fuses should be used.
* Even in hotel rooms, portable IT systems should not be left unsecured. The device can z. B. be included in the hotel room safe, so that a first inhibition threshold for the theft or misuse of mobile IT systems is established. However, high-security information should not be kept in an in-house safe.
* Protective information that is not essential should not be carried when traveling. If this is necessary, information should be carried in hand luggage. The hand luggage must never be left unattended.
* Important notes and general instructions for appropriate storage and transport of portable IT systems should be summarized separately on a leaflet, in addition to the inclusion in the security policy for users.
#### CON.7.M14 Cryptographically secured e-mail communication [user, IT operation]

E-mails should be cryptographically secured by the employees according to the internal guidelines of the institution.

When sending e-mail abroad, users should encrypt their e-mails if they contain sensitive information so that they are only known to the sender and recipient as part of the end-to-end encryption. Emails should be encrypted so that they can not be manipulated on the way between sender and receiver. E-mails without confidential information should at least be signed to ensure the authenticity of the communication partners.

Users should not access their e-mails via public IT systems, since access data or even the content of the e-mails could get into unauthorized hands. Such public IT systems include, for. B. Surfstations in hotels or computers in Internet cafes. These are untrusted.

Implementation notes and recommendations for cryptographic protection of e-mail communication are contained in the module APP1.4 Groupware.

### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### CON.7.M15 Radiation security of portable IT systems [IT operation] (C)

It should be determined prior to the journey what protection needs the individual information that is processed on mobile data carriers or clients abroad. Information-bearing or even exposing radiation of these data carriers and clients can be received or intercepted by others, so that information can be reconstructed and the confidentiality of these data can be called into question. The institution should here check whether such a protection requirement exists for confidential information that requires low-radiation or secure data carriers and clients.

PC screen manufacturers often use the term "low-radiation" according to MPR II, TCO or SSI. However, these guidelines take into account only possible harmful effects of equipment radiation. The measurement methods and limit values ​​for the radiation are therefore unsuitable for the detection of radiating radiation and, like measurements for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), do not allow an assessment of the security against unauthorized reading of the data.

In addition, however, special radiation-protected IT systems are also offered. A detailed test concept of the BSI is used for graduated testing of IT equipment or systems. The basic idea of ​​this concept is to adapt the scope of the protective measures as well as possible to the threat situation assumed by the user in order to achieve optimum radiation safety at minimum cost. So z. In many cases, for example, a device tested according to the zone model (see BSI concept for the protection of state classified information) and approved for use in zones 1-3 (so-called "Zone 1 device") already offers sufficient protection against unauthorized interception of confidential data offer due to exposing radiation.
As an example, it should be mentioned that in keyboards due to the electromagnetic radiation of the keyboard matrix and the connecting cable there is a risk of eavesdropping. This also applies to wireless keyboards. However, in the case of wired keyboards, the risk of eavesdropping is generally much lower than the danger of eavesdropping due to the use of radio communication links with wireless input devices. For systems with proprietary security measures that do not have a security certificate, the security value is unpredictable. The user runs the risk that the manufacturer's non-evaluated solution provides only minimal security, but is far from sufficient to effectively protect his data.

In the case of high or very high confidentiality requirements, it should therefore be checked whether a manufacturer offers radiation-protected equipment in accordance with these so-called "TEMPEST" criteria in its delivery program.

This can be clarified by a consultation with the manufacturer, the BSI or by inspection of the official product overview BSI TL 03305, which is available on the website of the BSI under the keyword Publications. The statement that a device has TEMPEST approval always includes the statement of the degree of approval (eg approved for use in zones 1-3 according to the zone model).

#### CON.7.M16 Integrity protection through checksums or digital signatures (I)

Check totals are used in the context of data transfer or data backup to preserve the integrity of the data. Checksums (checksums, hashes) is a value that verifies the integrity of data. Before z. B. the sending of data should be calculated on the sender side, the check sum of stored or transmitted data via a corresponding program. On the receiver side, the check sum from the received data should be calculated using the same procedure and both check sums should be compared. A comparison of both checksums indicates the correctness or manipulation of the transferred data.

Better yet, digital signatures should be used to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. Digital signatures are asymmetric cryptosystems, where z. For example, an e-mail or a file is provided with a value known as a digital signature. This signature can ensure the integrity of a document via a check sum and a timestamp for a defined time. By using an appropriately assigned verification key, the recipient of this message can determine the integrity of this message.

If the mobile IT system has ** integrity check ** mechanisms, the following requirements are useful:

* Integrity checking procedures should be used that can reliably detect deliberate manipulation of the IT system or the data stored on it, as well as unauthorized application of programs.
* For data transfer mechanisms must be used, with which intentional manipulations of the metadata and the payload can be detected. In addition, the mere knowledge of the algorithms used without special additional knowledge may not be sufficient to make unrecognized manipulations of the above data.
#### CON.7.M17 Using Dedicated Travel Hardware [IT Operations] (CIA)

In order to prevent the unauthorized outflow of sensitive information of the institution on trips abroad (eg at the entry or the exit) employees should be provided with preconfigured travel notebooks. These travel notebooks should, based on the minimal principle, only provide the functions and information absolutely necessary for the continuation of the business.
#### CON.7.M18 Restricted Permissions on Foreign Travel [IT-Betrieb, Fachverantwortliche] (CI)

Before starting your journey, the institution should check which authorizations the employee really needs in order to be able to pursue his day-to-day business abroad. It should be checked whether access rights, on z. B. Internal drives of the institution for which travel time can be withdrawn from the employee to prevent unauthorized access to them. The user then only has access to those drives which are essential for the performance of his activity.

For stays abroad, care must be taken to ensure that the user environment and startup procedure are adapted to the user and to his task. If editor programs or compilers are not required for the task fulfillment of the user, the use abroad must be prevented. The modification or abort of start scripts by the user must be prevented. It is a rule to make the user environment of temporary user accounts when traveling abroad. When traveling abroad, existing security measures and features of the IT operating system used, such as User Account Control (UAC), must be activated in order to enforce the limitation of the user environment. The access of foreign travelers to the internal network must be limited to the necessary extent.
