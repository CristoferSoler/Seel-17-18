G 0.7 Major events in the environment
==============================

Major events of all kinds can lead to obstacles to the proper operation of an authority or a company. These include street parties, concerts, sporting events, labor disputes or demonstrations. Riots associated with such events can have additional effects, such as intimidation of employees, or violence against the staff or the building.

Examples:

* During the hot summer months, a demonstration took place near a data center. The situation escalated and violence occurred. There was a window in the data center area in a side street, through which a protester penetrated and used the opportunity to steal hardware with important data.
* When constructing a major fairground, a power line was accidentally cut off. This led to a failure in a data center, which could be intercepted by the existing network backup system.
