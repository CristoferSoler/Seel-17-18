G 0.16 Theft of devices, data carriers or documents
================================================== ========

The theft of data carriers, IT systems, accessories, software or data incurs reimbursement costs and the restoration of a workable state, as well as losses due to a lack of availability. If theft reveals confidential information, it may cause further damage. In addition to servers and other expensive IT systems, mobile IT systems that are inconspicuous and easy to transport are often stolen. However, there are also cases in which targeted data carriers, such as documents or USB sticks, have been stolen in order to access the confidential information stored thereon.

Examples:

* In the spring of 2000, a notebook from the US State Department disappeared. An official statement did not rule out that the device might contain confidential information. Nor was it known whether the device was secured cryptographically or by other means against unauthorized access.
* In a German Federal Office was repeatedly broken through the same unsecured windows. In addition to other valuables, mobile IT systems also disappeared. Whether files were copied or manipulated, could not be excluded beyond doubt.
* In the UK, there were a number of data breaches where confidential records were disclosed because media was stolen. In one case, the British Air Force stole several computer hard drives that contained very personal information collected for employee security screening.
* A call center employee made copies of a large amount of confidential customer data just before leaving the company. After leaving the company, he sold the data to competitors. Since details of the incident were subsequently leaked to the press, the call center lost many important customers.
