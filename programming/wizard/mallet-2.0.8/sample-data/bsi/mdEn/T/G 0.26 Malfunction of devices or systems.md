G 0.26 Malfunction of equipment or systems
=============================================

Today, devices and systems that serve information processing often have many functions and therefore have a correspondingly complex structure. Basically, this affects both hardware and software components. Due to the complexity, there are many different sources of error in such components. As a result, it often happens that devices and systems do not work as intended and thus create security problems.

There are many causes of malfunctions, for example material fatigue, manufacturing tolerances, conceptual weaknesses, exceeding limit values, unforeseen operating conditions or lack of maintenance. Since there are no perfect devices and systems, a certain residual probability for malfunctions must always be accepted anyway.

Malfunction of any device or system may compromise all basic information security values ​​(confidentiality, integrity, availability). In addition, malfunctions may possibly go unnoticed over a longer period of time. As a result, for example, calculation results can be falsified and not corrected in time.

Examples:

* Due to a clogged ventilation grille, a storage system overheats, which then does not completely fail, but has only sporadic malfunctions. Only a few weeks later it is noticed that the stored information is incomplete.
* A standard scientific application is used to perform a statistical analysis on a pre-recorded dataset stored in a database. According to the documentation, however, the application is not released for the database product used. Although the analysis seems to work, sampling shows that the calculated results are wrong. The cause identified compatibility issues between the application and the database.
