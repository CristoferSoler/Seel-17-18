### 1.1 Introduction

Every company and authority must have an organization that controls the interaction of the various roles and units with the business processes and resources in the institution. Most institutions have an organizational unit responsible for the regulation and management of the general operation as well as for the planning, organization and execution of all administrative services. Various information security tasks must be implemented or supported by this unit.

### 1.2 Life cycle

An adequate level of security can only be achieved in an institution if comprehensive rules on information security are made mandatory. A number of measures have to be implemented for this purpose, starting with the definition and assignment of responsible persons for individual objects (eg information, business processes, applications, IT components), corresponding organizational security guidelines and instructions, and the handling of assets worthy of protection. The steps that should be followed in the sense of a continuous, repetitive information security process and the actions that should be followed in each step are listed below.

** planning and conception **

For the initiation and implementation of the processes resulting from the security objectives and security guidelines, organizational and personal arrangements must be made. Where appropriate, the co-determination rights of the Staff Committee must be maintained (see ORP.1.M10 Timely participation of the Staff / Works Council). The different levels of organization and people working here need concrete instructions and responsibilities to handle their processes (see ORP.1.M2 Assignment of Responsibility for Information, Applications and IT Components).

The strategic considerations are to be detailed in an operational concept regarding their implementation in the company or in the authority.

The use of the required equipment must be coordinated with the task fulfillment and the safety requirements and must be documented by resource management (see ORP.1.M7 Resource Management). This must be complete and kept up-to-date by appropriate processes.

Prerequisites for a functioning infrastructure, which can also adequately respond to malfunctions, are regulations for the procurement of spare parts, repairs and maintenance work (see ORP.1.M11 Regulations for Maintenance and Repair Work). In maintenance contracts, the scheduling and maintenance of individual IT systems (or groups) must be regulated, as well as the required access (remote, on-site) and the response times of the personnel assigned to maintain the safety requirements.

The distribution of tasks and the required functions (see ORP.1.M4 Separation of functions between operational and controlling tasks) must be structured in such a way that operational and controlling functions are distributed to different persons in order to minimize or completely eliminate conflicts of interest among the persons involved.

**Business**

The defined conceptions are set out in concrete instructions and adopted bindingly for operation. Employee-related regulations must look at the complete career of an employee in the institution from entry to exit. By applying the need-to-know principle and the four-eyes principle, it must be ensured that authorizations at the various levels (eg access to rooms, access to information systems) are purposefully allocated and are also practicable (see ORP.1.M5 granting permissions).These permissions must be documented and supported by various methods, such as: B. Controlled and verifiable issue of keys only to authorized persons, authentication of access, access control systems for specially secured areas and control of operations outside the company (see ORP.1.M3 supervision or assistance of third parties). If regulations are deliberately or unconsciously violated, the information and escalation processes derived from this must be known to the employees, so that a targeted reaction to the violation can take place (see ORP.1.M9 Response to violations of the security specifications).

** ** segregation

Discs, operating and material resources that are subject to special protection conditions must be disposed of in such a way that no conclusions can be drawn as to their use or contents (see ORP.1.M8 Proper Disposal of Protected Equipment). For this purpose, appropriate regulations, if necessary also with external companies, have to be made. Corresponding provisions of data protection must be observed.

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the Organization section.

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### ORP.1.M1 Definition of Responsibilities and Regulations [Institutional Management]

Responsibilities should be comprehensible for all essential tasks and business processes in an institution. The tasks should be tailored so that there is no overlap between similar tasks, but also no responsibility gaps. This should be a matter of course for all areas, but it is indispensable for all security-related tasks.

The security-related tasks of all internal and external employees and service providers must be clearly defined. They must be aligned with the security objectives of the institution. Some of the areas that should be covered include:

* Explicit allocation of responsibilities and authorizations to roles or organizational units in all security-related tasks (ensuring that all roles are assigned to specific persons),
* Appropriate handling of business-critical information so that their confidentiality, integrity and availability are adequately protected.
* Confidentiality agreements,
Involvement of the safety officer in assignments and projects concerning business critical information
* Briefings on the proper handling of business-critical information, for example, in contact with customers or when traveling;
* Definition of rules of conduct and information requirements for safety-related actions and incidents
* Classification of information according to their protection needs.
The information security arrangements should be properly aligned with those for data protection and security so that they can be more easily adapted and perceived by employees. It is also important that all regulations taken together are consistent.

Comprehensive information security regulations must be set bindingly.

It is best to have arrangements among other things about the topics

* Data backup,
* Data archiving,
* Data carrier transport,
* Data transmission,
* Disk destruction,
* Documentation of IT procedures, software, IT configuration,
* Access, access and access permissions,
* Maintenance and repair work,
* Data protection,
* Protection against malware,
* Revision,
* Emergency preparedness and
* How to violate security policies
hold true. Further information can be found in the relevant IT-Grundschutz modules.If information is to be exchanged between two or more communication partners, a number of different aspects must be observed in order to protect it. For any type of information exchange, it must first be clarified

* how vulnerable these are,
* with whom these may be exchanged and
* how these are to be protected.
For this purpose, there should be clear and comprehensible rules that cover all forms of information exchange, such as verbal exchange as well as data exchange via data carrier, mail, fax, (mobile) telephone or Internet. In general, it should be ensured that information can not get into the wrong hands, eyes and ears and they can not be changed unnoticed. All employees should be aware that they are responsible for adequately protecting internal information. The way in which analogue and electronic information is to be protected in the exchange of information is described in detail in the modules OPS.1.2.3 Information and data medium exchange and APP.1.1 E-mail / Groupware.

The regulations that have come into force must be announced to the affected employees in an appropriate manner (see ORP.5 Requirements Management (Compliance)). It is advisable to document the information provided by the employees. In addition, all regulations in the current version must be kept in one place and made accessible to legitimate interest.

The regulations have to be updated regularly in order to avoid misunderstandings, unresolved responsibilities and contradictions and to dissolve them if necessary. All regulations should therefore include a creation date or a version number.

#### ORP.1.M2 Assignment of responsibility for information, applications and IT components [Head of IT, Information Security Officer (ISB), Head of Institution]

In order to achieve comprehensive overall security, the involvement of all staff of an institution in the implementation of the necessary security measures is required. For all information, business processes, applications and IT components, therefore, it must be determined who is responsible for these and their security. For this purpose, a specific person (including representatives) and no abstract group should always be named, so that responsibility is clearly visible at all times. For more complex information, applications and IT components, all responsible parties and their representatives should be mentioned by name.

Conversely, of course, all employees should know which information, business processes, applications and IT components they are responsible for and in which way.

Each employee is responsible for what lies within his sphere of influence, unless it is explicitly regulated differently. For example, the lead level of the institution is responsible for all the fundamental decisions when introducing a new application, the IT lead, and IT security management to develop IT component security policies, administrators for their correct implementation, and users to handle them carefully related information, applications and systems.

The subject managers as the "owners" of information and applications must ensure that

* the protection needs of information, business processes, applications and IT components have been correctly determined
* the necessary security measures are implemented,
* this is checked regularly (eg daily, weekly, monthly),
* the tasks for the implementation of the security measures are clearly defined and assigned,
* the access or access to the information, applications and IT components is regulated,
* The information security-threatening deviations are documented in writing.The responsible persons together with the information security management must decide, how to deal with possible residual risks.

#### ORP.1.M3 Supervision or assistance of third parties [employees]

Persons who are not members of the institution, such as visitors, craftsmen, maintenance and cleaning personnel, should not be left unattended, except in rooms that are expressly intended for this purpose (see also ORP.1.M5 Assignment of Permissions). All employees should be advised that they will be required to take care of outsiders they encounter unattended within the Authority or the Company from that moment on. This not only serves the safety of all, but is also a positive service aspect for non-employees.

If it becomes necessary to leave an external person alone in the office, a colleague should be asked to enter the room or the visitor to a colleague.

If it is not possible to constantly accompany or supervise other persons (eg cleaning staff), at least no information and devices should be freely accessible at the personal work area, for example cabinets are locked and access locks are activated for IT devices, see also ORP. 1.M6 The tidy workplace.

For the home workplace, family members and visitors are only allowed to be alone in the work area if all work documents are kept locked up and the IT is secured via an activated access protection.

The necessity of this measure should be explained to the employees and kept in a safety guideline. A documentation about the stay of foreign persons can be led in a visitors book.

#### ORP.1.M4 Function separation between operational and controlling tasks

In each institution, the tasks required to perform the business processes must be defined and assigned to roles or people. It should be noted that there are tasks that can not be combined.

Responsibilities for all business processes and related tasks must be clearly defined (see ORP.1.M1 Definition of Responsibilities and Regulations). The demarcations and overlaps between the different roles and functions must be clearly defined. The tasks and the required roles and functions must be structured in such a way that operational and controlling functions are distributed to different persons in order to prevent conflicts of interest among the persons involved (separation of functions).

It is a ** separation of functions ** set and justified, d. H. which functions or roles are incompatible with each other, and therefore may not be perceived by ** a ** person at the same time. Requirements for this can result from the tasks themselves or from legal provisions. ** Examples ** for this are:

* Rights management and revision,
* Network administration and revision,
* Programming and testing with own software,
* Data collection and payment order authorization,
* Revision and payment order authority.
In particular, it becomes clear that mostly operative functions are not compatible with controlling functions.

Once the separation of functions has been determined, the functions can be assigned to persons. Representative regulations must also be taken into account and documented (see also ORP.2 Personnel).

The stipulations have to be documented and updated with changes in business processes. Should a person have to perform incompatible functions with this assignment, this should be emphasized in a corresponding documentation about the distribution of functions.

#### ORP.1.M5 Authorization [Head IT]At the various levels, appropriate and workable permissions MUST be allocated (eg for access to premises, access to IT systems, access to applications). Only as many rights should be assigned as are necessary for the task perception. There must be a regulated procedure for the assignment, administration and withdrawal of authorizations (see also ORP.4 Identity and Permission Management).

** Assignment of access authorizations **

Before assigning access rights to persons, the vulnerable rooms of a building must be determined, eg. Office, data carrier archive, server room, technical room, data center. The protection requirement of a room is derived from the protection requirements of the information processed in the respective room, the IT systems available there and the data carriers that are stored and used in this room.

It then has to be determined which person needs which access right to perform the function. The function separation (ORP.1 M4 separation of functions between operational and controlling tasks) has to be considered. Unnecessary access rights are to be avoided.

In order to minimize the number of persons authorized to enter a room, the principle of separation of functions should be taken into account. To prevent z. B. a separate storage of IT spare parts and data carriers the unauthorized access of a maintenance technician to the disk.

The allocation and withdrawal of access authorizations must be documented. When withdrawing an access authorization, the return of the means of access must be guaranteed. In addition, it must be documented which conflicts have occurred in the allocation of access authorizations to persons. There may be grounds for conflict because people perceive functions that conflict with the separation of functions with regard to the access authorizations, or because of spatial necessities.

Persons (gatekeepers, closing service) or technical facilities (passport readers, biometric procedures such as iris scanners or fingerprints, security door locks or locking systems) can be used to monitor the access authorization (see INF.1 Building). Access to rooms requiring protection from unauthorized personnel (eg visitors, cleaning and maintenance personnel) may only be carried out in the presence or accompanied by authorized persons.

Regulations on the assignment and withdrawal of access authorizations for external staff and visitors must also be taken.

** Assignment of access rights **

Access privileges allow the data subject or an authorized representative to use certain IT systems or system components and networks. Access authorizations should be granted as restrictively as possible. These are to be specified for each authorized person on the basis of their function, taking into account the separation of functions (see ORP.1.M4 Separation of functions between operational and controlling tasks). According to the function, the access to the IT systems has to be defined. B. Access to the operating system (system administrator) or access to an IT application (user). In addition, it must be ensured that personnel and task-related changes are taken into consideration without delay.

Access to IT systems or IT applications should only be possible after an identification (eg by name, user ID or chip card) and authentication (eg by password or via an authentication token) of the authorized user and logged become.The issue or withdrawal of means of access such as user IDs or smart cards must be documented. Regulations on the handling of access and authentication means (eg handling of chip cards, password handling, see ORP.4 identity and authorization management) must also be taken. All persons entitled to access must be made aware of the correct handling of the means of access.

Access authorizations should be temporarily blocked by authorized persons in the event of longer absences in order to prevent misuse; B. in illness or leave. This should be done at least for people with far-reaching permissions like administrators.

Correct compliance must be monitored sporadically.

** Granting of access rights **

Access rights regulate which persons are empowered to use IT applications or data as part of their functions. The access rights (for example, read, write, execute) to IT applications, subapplications or data depend on the function that a person performs, for example: B. User support, work preparation, system programming, application development, system administration, revision, data collection, administration. At the same time, only as many access rights should be assigned as are necessary for the task perception ("need-to-know principle"). The access rights must be implemented through the rights management of the respective IT systems.

A large number of IT systems allow different rights to be defined as group rights or rights profiles (eg data collection group). This definition corresponds to the technical implementation of the rights assigned to a function. For the administration of the rights of an IT system, it is advantageous to create such groups or profiles, as this can considerably simplify the assignment of rights and their updating.

The specification and modification of access rights must be initiated and documented by the responsible person. The documentation must show:

* which function is provided with which access rights, taking into account the separation of functions (see ORP.1.M4 Separation of functions between operational and controlling tasks),
* which groups or profiles are set up,
* which person perceives which function,
* which access rights a person receives in the context of which role (the access rights of representatives should also be recorded here) and
* which conflicts have occurred during the allocation of access rights. These conflicts can z. B. result from the fact that a person perceives incompatible functions or the fact that depending on the IT system, the separation of certain access rights can not be made.
* which persons in an emergency receive which access rights, eg. Because they belong to the crisis staff.
The procedure for separating functions and assigning rights is explained in the following example.

The application considered is a travel expense accounting system. The relevant rooms are explained in the following graphic. The IT system consists of a LAN, in addition to a server and the control panel, three PCs are connected as workstations.

Figure: Task distribution and function separation

** Step 1: Task allocation and separation of functions **

The following functions are necessary for the Travel Expenses system under consideration:

The following functions are incompatible due to constraints:

* Function 1 and Function 2 (the administration can not control itself)
* Function 2 and function 6 (the authorizing officer is not allowed to control himself)
* the combination of functions 4 or 5 with 6 (the four-eyes principle would be violated for payment instructions)
These functions are performed by the following persons:

Table 1: Example of task distribution and function separation** Step 2: Assignment of access rights **

The protection requirements of the individual rooms are explained below and the assignment of the access rights is documented in the table:

* Server room:
 Unauthorized access to the server must be prevented because the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the entire application depends on this core component.
* Document archive: For the accounting, the travel expense reports must be kept longer term. It must be ensured that the vouchers are kept complete and unchanged
* Office 1: In this office, the necessary data are recorded and the mathematical and factual correctness determined. In order to ensure the correctness of these processes, it is necessary to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to the workstation computers.
* Office 2: Here the payment of travel expenses is arranged at the APC. This procedure may only be performed by an authorized person. Unauthorized persons are to be refused access.
Table 2: Example of the allocation of access authorizations

Step 3: Assignment of access rights

Due to the functions the following access rights result:

Table 3: Example of the allocation of access authorizations

Step 4: Assign access rights

In the following, the access rights that a function needs to be exercised are shown. They denote:

A = right to execute the application / software

L = read right to data

S = write right, i. Generating data

M = right to modify data

Ö = right to delete data

U = right to sign payment instructions

Table 4: Example of assigning access permissions

Such documentation facilitates the distribution of rights. Assuming that Ms. Schmidt would change her employer and her job would have to be filled anew, the tables above make it easy to determine which of Ms. Schmidt's former rights should be erased and set up for the new force. If the new force is additionally to assume the function of processing with the authority to order, then the conflict becomes apparent on the basis of the distribution of rights that the new force could carry out manipulations unnoticed in the event of substitution.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures correspond to the state of the art in the field of "organization".

#### ORP.1.M6 The tidy workplace [employee]

All employees should be encouraged to leave their jobs "tidy". Unauthorized persons should not have access to confidential information in other workplaces or manipulate business processes or IT systems. Employees must therefore ensure that unauthorized persons have no access to IT applications or access to data. All employees must check their jobs with the same care and ensure that no sensitive information is freely accessible and the availability, confidentiality or integrity of data can not be adversely affected. It must not be possible for unauthorized persons to access data carriers or documents (eg printouts).

For a short absence during working hours, it is sufficient to lock the room, if possible, and / or to lock IT systems in such a way that accesses are only possible after successful authentication. In the event of a planned absence of an employee (eg longer meetings, business trips, holidays, training events), the workplace should be cleaned up so that no data carriers or documents requiring protection are left unlocked at the workplace. For this, the employees need sufficiently dimensioned and lockable storage options, such. B. stable cabinets.Also, passwords should never be kept visible (as sticky notes on the monitor, in an easily guessed place such as under the desk top or in the unlocked desk drawer) (see ORP.1, A7 Resource Management).

Supervisors and security management staff should sporadically check jobs to see if vulnerable information is openly accessible and employees point to proper cleanup.

#### ORP.1.M7 Device Management [Head of IT, Head of Production and Production, Head of Building Services]

In institutions, different devices are used depending on the industry to support the business processes. In addition to IT systems that can be identified as such, many other types of devices can affect information security. Such devices include, for example

* ICS components
* Air conditioners and other home appliances
* Coffee machines
Even devices such as coffee makers, which do not directly support information processing or other business processes, can compromise information security, such as: B. if a cable fire causes consequential damage, but also if devices of this kind are integrated for better resource control in the IT network.

Therefore, the institution should have an overview of which devices are deployed where and what information security requirements may arise, such as regular review of operational security, maintenance or patching.

Device management includes the following tasks:

* Procurement
* Examination before use
* Identification
* Inventory management
When acquiring devices of any kind, people should always ask themselves whether these devices could have an impact on information security. It is recommended that the ISB occasionally discuss with the procurers what types of equipment are currently being procured or planned in the institution. In addition, he should make them aware that non-IT systems can also contain IT functions (Internet of Things) and what types of cyber attacks are possible.

When procuring equipment, it should also be clarified whether employees need to be trained on their use and at what intervals which maintenance activities are required.

Before using the devices, they should be checked for operational safety and information security using a regulated ** test procedure **. In addition, the following steps should be performed:

* The completeness of deliveries should be checked to ensure the availability of all delivered parts.
* Test runs should check operability.
* The compatibility of new components with existing ones should be checked before procurement, so that it does not come to wrong purchases.
* Prior to use, the equipment should undergo an approval and release process. It is important to ensure that non-centrally procured devices undergo an approval and release process. The use of private devices should also be regulated.
There should be a ** survey ** of the types and locations of all existing equipment. Based on an overview, it is also possible to carry out completeness checks, to check whether unapproved devices are used in the institution or whether devices have been stolen. For this purpose, a clear ** identification ** of the essential devices with clear identification features is recommended (eg grouped consecutive inventory numbers).

Such an overview should be able to provide information about:

* Identification features,
* Procurement sources, delivery times,
* Whereabouts of the devices,
* Maintenance contracts, maintenance intervals.In order to prevent the misuse of data, the deletion or destruction of devices must be regulated if they are able to store information, see block CON.6 Delete and Destroy.

 ** Internet of Things (IoT) **

IoT devices are often characterized by having manageable, limited external dimensions, often being priced below limits that require a burdensome procurement process in institutions, and / or not highlighting Internet functionality. Therefore, it is likely that any type of survey or inventory will overlook IoT devices. It is important to get an overview of which IoT devices are currently or soon to be used in the institution.

For this, it can be a sensible approach for the ISB to go into different premises of the institution and to consider which of the existing components require power and whether they could be networked via IT networks. In particular, the ISB should speak with colleagues from the building services sector, but also with the other equipment managers, and explain the functionalities of the various devices. Networking could take place, for example, via IT cabling or WLAN with the LAN, via mobile radio to the Internet, but also via free WLANs in the environment or other radio interfaces such as Bluetooth. In addition, regular network scans should be carried out, looking for network traffic anomalies and non-assignable devices.

Devices with IoT functionalities can be in institutions for example:

* Private devices brought by employees or external persons, eg. Smartwatches, fitness bracelets and other gadgets.
* Devices procured and operated by the institution, such as fire, gas and other alarms, coffee machines or building control elements. The transitions to ICS systems are fluent here.
In this case, IoT devices are not always recognizable as such at first glance, for example, if the IoT functionality is not a purchase-critical feature, but for the manufacturer thereby a profitable for him data collection is possible, eg. B. on the type and quantity of consumables.

An example of devices in which IoT functionalities could hide are comfort furniture that automatically adapts to the particular user and not only stores the settings locally, but also exchanges them with other workstations via IT networks, allowing employees to work anywhere work ("smart workplaces").

#### ORP.1.M8 Resource Management [IT Leader]

Equipment (or material) refers to all work equipment that is required to complete a task or business process. This includes, for example, all necessary tools, equipment and furniture. Resources for IT use are resources such as hardware components (computer, keyboard, printer, etc.), software (system software, custom programs, standard programs and the like), consumables (paper, toner, printer cartridges), data carriers (hard disks, removable disks, CD-ROMs). ROMs and the like). The resource management includes the execution of the tasks:

* Procurement of resources,
* Testing before use,
* Marking and
* Inventory management.
The ** procurement ** of equipment is of particular importance in the use of information technology. In particular, the objectives pursued by the use of information technology can be supported by a regulated procurement process: increased performance, cost-effectiveness, improvement of communication options.

In addition to pure cost-effectiveness aspects, a new procurement procedure - which can be carried out from a central point - also allows for new and further developments in the field of information technology to be taken more into account.Central procurement also ensures the adoption and adherence to a "house standard" that simplifies employee training and maintenance activities.

A regulated ** test procedure before use ** of the equipment avoids various hazards. Examples are:

* The completeness of deliveries (eg manuals or connection cables) should be checked to ensure the availability of all delivered parts.
* New software and new preformatted media should be tested with a computer virus protection program.
* Test runs of new software should be performed on special test systems so that they can be put into operation smoothly.
* Compatibility of new hardware and software components with existing ones should be verified prior to procurement to prevent mis-purchases.
It is only with the help of ** Inventory Management ** of the equipment used that it is possible to determine the consumption and to arrange reorders that are required in due time. In addition, Inventory Management allows for completeness checks, review of the use of unauthorized software, or detection of resource theft. This requires a clear ** identification ** of the essential equipment with clear identification features (eg grouped consecutive inventory numbers). In addition, the serial numbers of existing devices such as monitors, printers, hard drives, etc. should be documented so that they can be identified after a theft.

For inventory management, resources must be listed in inventories. Such an inventory must be able to provide information about:

* Identification features,
* Procurement sources, delivery times,
* Whereabouts of resources,
* Warehousing,
* Handing out regulations and
* Maintenance contracts, maintenance intervals.
In order to prevent the misuse of data, the deletion or destruction of resources must be regulated. In particular, the handling of waste paper must be regulated. There must be appropriate disposal options for consumer goods with higher protection requirements, eg. B. so-called shredders or shredders for paper. Everything else is described in the block CON.6 Deleting and Destroying.

#### ORP.1.M9 Proper Disposal of Protected Equipment [Employees, Information Security Officer (ISB)]

Equipment or material (eg printer paper, magnetic tapes, hard disks, CD-ROM, DVDs, USB sticks, flash memory or cards, toner cartridges) will eventually no longer be needed or have to be discarded due to defects. If they contain sensitive data, they must be disposed of in such a way that no conclusions can be drawn about previously stored data. For functional media, the data should be physically deleted. Non-functioning or only once recordable data carriers such as files or CD-ROMs and DVDs must be mechanically destroyed (see CON.6 Delete and Destroy).

The nature of the disposal of vulnerable material should be regulated in a specific safety policy. In the institution, the necessary disposal facilities such as shredders must be available.

If material that is in need of protection is collected before disposal, the collection must be kept locked and protected against unauthorized access.

Insofar as no environmentally sound and safe disposal can be carried out in the company or in the authority, companies engaged to do so must be obliged to comply with the required safety measures. A model contract can be found under the IT Baseline Protection tools on the BSI websites. It should be checked regularly if the disposal process is reliable.#### ORP.1.M10 Responding to security breaches [Information Security Officer (ISB)]

It is necessary to define the response to breaches of the security policy in order to ensure a clear and immediate response.

Investigations should be performed to determine how and where the injury occurred. Subsequently, the appropriate remedial or mitigating measures must be implemented. If necessary, additional precautionary measures must be taken. The actions to be carried out depend on the nature of the infringement as well as the polluter.

It must be regulated who is responsible for contacts with other organizations to obtain information about known security vulnerabilities or to provide information about security breaches that have occurred. It must be ensured that eventually. Affected areas are informed as quickly as possible (see building block DER 2.1 Incident Management).

#### ORP.1.M11 Timely participation of the Staff Committee [Head of IT]

In all measures which in principle enable the behavior or performance monitoring of employees, for example logging, the co-determination of the staff representation is required. The basis for this in Germany are the company constitution and personnel representation laws of the Federation and the Länder. In other countries, the involvement of the Staff Committee is not always necessary. However, the timely and comprehensive information of the works council or staff council is generally recommended as it can improve the acceptance of measures in the area of ​​information security and prevent time delays in their implementation.

If there is already a suspicion that a security incident (see Building Block 2.1 Incident Management) has been triggered by an internal employee and appropriate investigations are to be carried out which result in sanctions, the participation rights of the personnel or works council must be strictly observed. If the Employee Representation is not properly involved, any further proceedings that may be required (if necessary before the Labor Court) can be seriously influenced by formalities, depending on the seriousness of the incident, for a warning or termination.

Large outsourcing service providers report from the field that the early involvement of the client's staff representatives, if possible already in the bidding phase, can greatly contribute to the success of the project. Employee willingness to change, motivation, job satisfaction and speedy project completion can all be positively influenced by cooperation between all parties involved. The same applies to the planned use of cloud services. A special feature here is that the above-mentioned requirements must be observed even when an institution decides on a private cloud.

#### ORP.1.M12 Regulations for maintenance and repair work [IT operation, building services, ICS information security officer]

In order to protect technical equipment from malfunctions and to ensure their operational safety, regular maintenance work must be carried out. This not only applies to IT systems, but also to ICS and IoT components. The timely initiation of maintenance work and the review of its implementation should be carried out from a central point (eg procuring entity). The maintenance should be carried out by trustworthy persons or companies, if they can not be carried out by own personnel. The instructions of the manufacturer must be strictly observed. Regular maintenance work by external persons may require the conclusion of a maintenance contract.For each device should be documented, when it was maintained and what errors were fixed. It is also advisable to set up an information system for maintenance and repair work. With such a system, upcoming work can be planned and documented work can be documented and the successful course can be controlled.

It should also document who is responsible for the maintenance or repair of equipment.

** Maintenance and repair work in the house **

For maintenance and repair work in the home, especially if they are carried out by external parties, regulations must be made regarding their ** supervision **: during the work, a competent person should supervise the work to the extent that they can judge whether during work unauthorized acts are performed. Furthermore, it must be checked whether the maintenance order has been carried out to the agreed extent.

As ** measures before and after maintenance and repair work ** are to be planned:

* Maintenance and repair work must be announced to the affected employees in good time.
* Maintenance technicians must identify themselves on request.
* Access to data by the service technician should be avoided as much as possible. If necessary, storage media must first be removed or deleted (after a complete backup), especially if the work has to be done externally. If deletion is not possible (eg due to a defect), the work must also be monitored externally or special contractual agreements must be made and trustworthy companies selected.
* The access, access and access rights granted to the maintenance technician must be limited to the necessary minimum and be revoked or deleted after the work.
* After performing maintenance or repair work, password changes are required, depending on the "depth of penetration" of the maintenance personnel. In the IT area, a check for malicious software should be carried out.
* The maintenance work carried out must be documented (scope, results, time, company name and possibly the name of the service technician).
* Represented companies should confirm in writing that they comply with relevant safety regulations and guidelines (eg VdS 2008 Flammable Work, Fire Protection Guidelines). This applies to all activities in which there may be a direct or indirect danger to buildings or people. Ultimately, it is important that the on-site personnel are familiar with these rules.
* After maintenance or repair work, check the proper functioning of the maintained system. In particular, the withdrawal of the interventions for testing purposes must be checked.
** External maintenance and repair work **

If IT systems are outsourced for maintenance or repair, all sensitive data stored on data media must be physically cleared beforehand. If this is not possible because the data carriers can no longer be accessed due to a defect, the companies responsible for the repair must undertake to comply with the required information security measures. In accordance with the requirements for confidentiality agreements from ORP.2 personnel, these contractual provisions on the confidentiality of data must be taken. In particular, it should be stipulated that data stored externally during maintenance should be completely deleted after completion of the work. Likewise, the duties and responsibilities of the external maintenance personnel must be carefully defined.When carrying out external maintenance work, it must be recorded which IT systems or components have been given to whom for repair, who caused this, what the maintenance or repair order includes, when the repair should be completed and when the device should be back was returned. In order to be able to keep up with this, it is necessary to mark the IT systems or components that identify which institution they belong to and, on the other hand, to clearly identify them within the institution.

When shipping or transporting the components to be repaired care should be taken to prevent damage and theft. If there is still sensitive information on or in the devices, they must be transported appropriately protected, eg. B. in sealed containers or by couriers. Furthermore, evidence of the shipping (repair order, accompanying note, dispatch notes) and receipt at the recipient (receipt confirmation) must be kept and archived.

For devices protected by passwords, depending on the extent of the repair work and the type of password protection, all or some passwords must either be disclosed or set to specified settings such as "REPAIR" so that the service technicians can access the devices.

After returning the devices, they must be checked for completeness. ** All ** passwords have to be changed. All data or programs residing on the repaired device should be checked for integrity.

Remote maintenance regulations can be found in OPS.2.4 Remote Administration.

#### ORP.1.M13 Relocation Security [Head of IT, Head of Domestic Engineering, Information Security Officer (ISB)]

When moving, not only furniture but also a wide variety of data carriers (eg paper, magnetic tapes, CD-ROMs, DVDs, removable hard disks) and IT systems must be transported. Information, IT systems and other materials leave the secured area of ​​the office environment and are transported by personnel who normally have no access rights. In a move, especially if larger parts of the institution are affected, a certain confusion can never be ruled out and it can not be permanently personally supervised each move box. Nevertheless, care must be taken to ensure that sensitive data is neither lost, damaged nor made accessible to unauthorized persons when moving.

The relocation planning should involve as early as possible the information security management and the data protection officer in order to define the framework conditions to be determined from the point of view of information security:

* When planning a move, it must be specified in advance who will move where and with what goods to be transported (creation of a move concept). This should be a matter of course anyway, so that the work can be resumed as smoothly as possible after the move.
* Depending on the protection requirements of the data, it must be determined which boundary conditions for the transport must be observed. For example, for more sensitive data, lockable transport containers (see OPS.1.2.3 Information and Media Exchange) should be used or the data carriers should be encrypted prior to transport.
* Data backups should be made before each IT system shipment. In addition to the modalities described in OPS.1.1.5 data backup, it should be noted in particular that the data backups must under no circumstances be transported together with the secure IT systems. This ensures that not all storage media will be damaged or lost at the same time.
* A leaflet should be prepared for all affected employees detailing all safety measures to be performed.In a move, not only the transport is a critical phase, but also the period shortly before or after. In this phase, experience has shown that many things are lost, because at this time the standard safety procedures such. B. the access control is not yet effective. Even during the move, therefore, certain minimum organizational requirements should be met:

* Transport documents should be issued for all materials to be transported, indicating that
 

 
+ whether a certain mode of transport is to be considered (eg fragile, computer special transport, etc.),
+ whether a certain type of packaging should be selected (eg for data carriers with confidential information),
+ where to bring them (exact building, floor and room description),
+ who are authorized recipients of the transported objects,
+ who picked you up or delivered you (including name, date and time
+ where to bring them (exact building, floor and room description),
+ who are authorized recipients of the transported objects,
+ who picked you up or delivered you (including name, date and time).

 

* The goods to be transported must be marked in such a way that they can be clearly identified, so that the transport route can also be traced. However, the labeling should not allow any conclusions as to the sensitivity of the content. The type of labeling should be chosen so that it can not be imitated and easily. For this purpose, the relocation preparers could provide special labels. Care must be taken to ensure that the labels can be detached from the objects even without residue, without damaging or contaminating the items to be moved.
* Even during a move, there should be no disorderly coming and going. The contracted removal companies should announce in advance the personal details of the intended employees. In case of sudden change of personnel (vacation, illness, etc.), the names of the substitute staff should be communicated at short notice. With a list of names of the persons involved in the move, the gatekeepers or other internal employees can then inspect sporadically or continuously depending on the property and circumstances. The external forces involved in the move should be provided with clearly visible identity cards (possibly with names) so that it is clear who is authorized to join.
* The goods to be transported, in particular the data media, must be kept safe before and after the move. The rooms in which no relocation activities take place, but in which there are no employees, so z. Those that have not yet been cleared or have already been granted should be closed.
After the move, an orderly operation should be started as soon as possible. First, the infrastructural and organizational security in the new offices to restore, so z. B.

* the access control should be resumed in full,
* the fire loads should be removed from the corridors, d. H. the moving boxes are moved to the new workspaces,
* the delivered removals are to check that they are complete and fully functional and not tampered with,* The completeness of the moving goods should be checked immediately by each employee and, if necessary, a loss list should be prepared. For this purpose, the affected person could also be given a form already prepared in advance, in which the removed removal goods can already be listed. Thus, even the absence representative may notice and report the absence of parts of the relocation property in the absence of leave, illness or urgent business activities of the affected colleagues. The responsible employee should receive a copy of this in order to be able to report any potential inconsistencies. Special care should be taken in the relocation planning for all servers and network interconnects, as even if only one component fails, the entire network may not be operational ,
Before relocating, the central IT administration should take various precautions to ensure a smooth workflow:

* Before the start of the relocation phase, a plan should be drawn up at an early stage for the required changes to the user connection. In particular, it should be analyzed whether new procurements are required for the smooth change of the computer connection of coworkers. Also for security reasons, it is important to know which changes result from the move in the communication behavior of the IT systems. For example, depending on the protection needs of employees, it may be necessary to encrypt a network connection or prevent access to certain data assets.
* Before an employee moves, it should be ensured that he can be reached in his new office via the local network and that his applications and services are operational. In addition to changes to the end device (routing, software configuration, etc.), this also necessitates rapid changes on the server side in the LAN or even on routers in the WAN. Here it may be necessary to set up new addresses or routes and delete old ones. It may be necessary to procure and set up new network components beforehand.
* When moving, it is often necessary to set up user accounts on a new server for the affected employees. It must be ensured that the required rights and access to applications and protocols are set up. Also, the security settings of the user environment must be maintained according to its security profile. Old user entries and terminal access entries must be adjusted or deleted on the old system. Nevertheless, access to user-defined data areas should remain granted to him for a transitional period, but with a mandatory reference to deletion after a grace period. After this waiting period, the deletion must be completed by the administrator.
Special precautions should be taken when relocating the components of the data center, such as data or communication servers. The following describes measures to ensure the shortest possible downtime of the components.

* If possible, a new server should be pre-installed and tested in the new facility. If this is not possible, then the old server should be preconfigured as well as possible and only be converted after sufficient advance notice at a time when little access is to be expected. Here, the old configuration should always be secured in advance.* The server should be completely secured before moving. If not already available, a bootable backup medium should also be created. Sensitive server parts such as hard disks should be kept redundant as an image for the failure of the original and be transported separately from the server. It is important to ensure that the data backup and the image as well as the server during transport is secured (eg encryption, locked box, security).
* Before moving, ensure that the infrastructure in the new premises is in place and tested for proper server operation. In addition to the presence of the network (electricity, LAN, WAN), it is important to pay attention to the correct order of the move of the components. It makes little sense, for example, to have the Internet web server moved first, if the firewall with its communication router is built much later.
* Prior to the move, it should be checked whether the IT components to be transported are those that require special environmental conditions during the move. For example, there are controllers for larger (and more expensive!) IT systems, which not only have to be operated in air-conditioned rooms, but also have to be air-conditioned.
Furthermore, it should be ensured that the new telephone numbers are already reachable as soon as the employees have moved into their new offices. When moving within a location should try to keep the old phone numbers, at least temporarily. During the move, telephone accessibility should be guaranteed both in the old and in the new property, so that questions can be answered at any time if problems arise.

### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ORP.1.M14 Inspections [Building Services, Information Security Officer (ISB)] (CIA)

A measure can only work as well as it is actually implemented. Checks provide the simplest means of checking the implementation of measures and compliance with requirements and instructions.

The patrols should not serve to find offenders to punish them. The purpose of the checks should be primarily to remedy any negligence detected as soon as possible (close windows, keep records, etc.). Secondly, causes of these negligence can be identified and possibly avoided in the future.

The check-ups should certainly also take place during the service period and be used to inform employees about the how and why of regulations. So they are considered by all parties more as a help rather than a goose.
