                <p style="text-align: justify">Note:
                The first edition of the IT Baseline Protection Compendium has been published. It provides the most commonly used building blocks of the 15th Supplemental Delivery of IT Baseline Protection Compendium. The second edition expands the IT Baseline Protection Compendium with new modules and other migrated components. A unique IT Baseline Protection Compendium will be distributed to building blocks that are not part of the first edition, but will be recreated with the second edition. For target objects, in the IT Baseline Protection Compendium there are no components yet, the corresponding modules of the IT Baseline Protection Compendium should be used.

                An overview of the structure of the first version of the IT Baseline Protection Compendium and the associated 80 building blocks is provided by Mindmap.</p>
