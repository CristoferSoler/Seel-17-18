### 1.1 Introduction

In this module, the secure exchange of information is considered, with a focus on digital and analog media as transport media, but also the exchange of information in personal meetings or via IT networks. Even with a broadband network connection, it may be useful or necessary to transmit data carriers for the exchange of information. One reason may be that there is no or no sufficiently trusted connectivity between the affected IT systems. Data carriers can be exchanged during personal meetings or via shipping.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to secure the exchange of information between different communication partners and IT systems. In particular, what is to be considered during data medium exchange in order to adequately protect the transported data is shown.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module is always to be used if there is an exchange of information with offices outside of your own institution or property and the internal network is not used. He is especially to be applied when

* new transport routes are built up (new communication partners, new media, new networks),
* the exchange of information takes place with the help of data carriers. In addition to the transmission, the storage and handling of the data carriers must be taken into account.
The protection of network connections is covered in other components of the IT-Grundschutz Compendium. Further processing in the target IT system is not considered. In this module, the basic rules for a secure exchange of information are in the foreground, especially in the use of mobile data carriers. The reasons why there is no or no sufficiently trusted network between the affected IT systems are not considered.

In addition, this module also takes into account the storage of the data on the sender and receiver system, insofar as it is directly related to the data medium exchange, as well as the handling of the data carriers before or after the transfer. This module considers mobile data carriers such. As removable disks, optical media, USB sticks and hard drives and not to forget paper documents.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance for the exchange of information and data carriers:

### 2 1 Defective media

All types of media can cause damage, errors, or failures. The problem arises when the information stored on the data carriers is not stored elsewhere and can not be reconstructed quickly and easily.

** Impermissible temperature and humidity **

Extreme temperatures and humidity can affect the proper operation of media. For each type of data carriers there are defined limits, within which the proper function is guaranteed. If these are exceeded or exceeded, this can lead to malfunctions and device failures. With digital storage media, excessive temperature fluctuations or excessive humidity can lead to data errors.

** improperly packaged media **

During transport or shipping, data carriers are subject to special loads. For data carriers, even minor contamination can lead to data errors. Hard disks can be destroyed by the "head crash" of the read / write head, tapes or cassettes by direct mechanical action. CD-ROMs or DVDs may become unusable due to scratching of the surface.

** Data loss due to strong magnetic fields **
Typical disks with magnetizable storage media are removable disks, cassettes and tapes. These data carriers are sensitive to magnetic interference, so the proximity to such radiation sources should be avoided.

### 2 2 Not available on time

In the case of data medium exchange, it is of particular importance in many business processes that they can reach their recipient on time or be used there in a timely manner. Even small errors in labeling can cause a disk does not reach its destination in the required time. If the required interfaces or resources are not available on site, a data carrier may not be able to be read out. The resulting delays can lead to significant damage.

### 2 3 Unregulated transfer of information or data media

In the event of an unregulated transfer or disorderly delivery of information or data carriers, there is a risk that confidential information may get into unauthorized hands or fail to reach the desired destination in time.

### 2 4 Inadequate key management with encryption

If encryption systems are used to protect the confidentiality of data to be transmitted, the desired protection can be undermined due to inadequate key management, for example if easily guessable keys have been selected or if the cryptographic keys used for encryption or decryption do not reach the communication partner in a secure way , The simplest negative example is the sending of the encrypted information and the key used on or with the same data medium. In this case, anyone who gains possession of the disk can decrypt the information, provided that the encryption method is known.

### 2 5 Loss of storage media

If data carriers are shipped in containers that are not particularly stable (envelopes or other packaging), there is a risk that the data carriers will be lost if the packaging is damaged. There is also the risk of loss to the recipient, by post or by carelessness of a messenger. Data carriers are becoming smaller and smaller so that they can be lost more easily during transport.

In addition, if the information on the media is not encrypted, they may fall into the wrong hands if lost.

### 2 6 Passing on false or internal information

When passing on information, it often happens that other information is transmitted in addition to the desired information. As a result, confidential information or information that is not suitable for publication keeps falling into the wrong hands. Thus, it happens that data carriers are passed on without the previously stored data being deleted in an appropriate manner. Similarly, confidential documents may be inadvertently mailed to the wrong recipient, or letters may be printed out and sent with internal comments.

### 2 7 Theft, tampering or destruction of data media

Outsiders, but also inner perpetrators, can try for various reasons (spying, revenge, malice, frustration) to steal, manipulate or destroy data carriers. The manipulations range from the unauthorized access to sensitive data about content changes of data to the destruction of data carriers.

### 2 8 Malicious programs in transferred files or on data carriers
If the work environment is insufficiently secured against malicious programs, malicious programs could be located on data media that are forwarded to external users. This could destroy or corrupt the stored data, but above all IT systems at the receiving end could be compromised. But the loss of image and the financial damage caused by malicious programs are also of great importance.

### 2 9 Unauthorized copying of information or data media

If information or data carriers are exchanged or transported via an insecure transport route, there is a risk that the information transmitted may be copied by unauthorized persons during transport. Likewise, attackers could try to intercept communications over IT networks.
