### 1.1 Introduction

The IT cabling covers all communication cables and passive components (patching or splice distributors, patch panels), which are operated on their own authority. It is therefore the physical basis of the internal communication networks of an institution. The IT cabling ranges from transfer points from a foreign network (eg connection of a telecommunications provider, DSL connection of an Internet provider) to the connection points of the network subscribers.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to protect the IT cabling in such a way that communication over these connections can neither be overheard nor manipulated nor disturbed.

### 1.3 Delimitation

Active network components (routers, switches, etc.) are not the subject of this module. Similarly, the subject of wireless networks and WLAN is excluded. These topics are dealt with in our own building blocks of the IT-Grundschutz Compendium. In this module, IT cabling is the physical basis of a manufacturer-neutral and application-neutral communication network, ie a Local Area Network (LAN). There is no distinction between IT cabling for data transport and TK cabling for telecommunications services.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the field of IT cabling:

### 2 1 Cable fire

Cable fires can cause serious damage. Some of these consequences are, for example, short circuits, the interruption of the protective conductor, the development of aggressive gases, fire or the development of smoldering fires. Cable fires often cause only a slight increase in the ambient temperature during the development phase. Thus, there is the additional risk that a significant amount of smoke by "cold" smoke occurs before smoke detectors attached to the ceiling.

### 2 2 Insufficient network dimensioning

If an IT network is not sufficiently sized, availability suffers. When planning networks, routes, server rooms or data centers, it is often the mistake to align the functional, capacitive or safety-related design exclusively to current requirements. It is overlooked that an expansion of the capacity of the network can be just as necessary by new requirements as z. Eg by changing technical standards. An extension of networks is only possible to the extent permitted by the existing, laid cables or the space available for additional cables.

### 2 3 Insufficient documentation of the wiring

If, due to insufficient documentation, the exact position of pipes is not known, construction work outside or inside a building may cause damage to pipes. It can not be assumed that all cables and wires in the installation zones are installed according to valid standards. Insufficient documentation also makes it difficult to inspect, maintain and repair cables.

### 2 4 Illegal cable connections

If cable connections are made between IT systems or other technical components that are not intended, there is a risk that this will cause safety problems or malfunction. For example, due to such improper cable connections, it is possible for unauthorized access to networks, systems, information or applications. Due to impermissible cable connections, information can be transmitted additionally or exclusively to incorrect receivers. The normal connection can be disturbed.

### 2 5 Line damage
The more unprotected a cable is, the greater the risk of damage. Damage does not necessarily lead immediately to a failure of connections, but can also cause sporadic, difficult to detect transmission errors. The accidental formation of impermissible connections is possible if, for example, cable sheaths or insulation are no longer completely intact. Damage does not necessarily have to be intentional, but may also occur unintentionally.

### 2 6 Line impairment

The transmission properties of cables with electrical signal transmission can be adversely affected by electrical and magnetic fields in their environment. Crosstalk is a special form of this line impairment. The disturbance is not generally generated in the environment, but by currents and voltages of signals that are transmitted to an adjacent line.

### 2 7 Listening and manipulation of lines

Listening to lines is a danger to information security that should not be neglected. Basically there are no tap-proof cables. Only with regard to the effort required for listening the cables differ. Whether a line is actually monitored is only detectable with high metrological effort. In addition to listening to lines, further deliberate manipulation or even the destruction of IT lines pose a danger to the institution. Malfunctions of lines can be deliberately and in a manipulative manner. Such manipulations often have the goal of disrupting IT operations or causing financial damage to the institution.
