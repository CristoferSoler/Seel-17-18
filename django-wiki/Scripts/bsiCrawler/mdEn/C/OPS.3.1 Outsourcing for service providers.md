### 1.1 Introduction

In outsourcing, outsourcing service providers take over business processes and services (eg security or cleaning staff) in whole or in part from outsourcing institutions (outsourcing customers). The operation of hardware and software can also be taken over as a service. Regardless of which services are taken over, this requires a close bond between the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer. The outsourcing service provider is not spared the risks associated with the outsourcing relationship. He must implement the risk-reducing security requirements that are generally defined by the outsourcing customer (see the OPS.2.1 Outsourcing for Customers module). It is not only in the interest of the outsourcing customer, but also that of the outsourcing service provider, to provide the agreed service and to comply with the agreed security level. In case of failure to meet the requirements imposed on him sometimes threatened high penalties and, where appropriate, other legal consequences that not only have financial implications, but can also damage the reputation sustainable. The focus of this module is therefore on requirements that deal with the planning, implementation, control and management of information security aspects in the context of outsourcing from the point of view of the service provider.

### 1.2 Objective

The module describes the requirements for the outsourcing service provider so that he can meet the security level of the outsourcing institution or avoid uncontrollable risks resulting from the business relationship.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The building block contains security requirements for outsourcing that service providers have to meet. It complements the requirements of protection for information of the outsourcing institution from the point of view of the outsourcing service provider.

Securing the transmission paths between the service provider and the customer of outsourcing services is not considered in this module.

The terms outsourcing and cloud have many parallels. For providers of outsourcing, requirements regarding the use of cloud services are generally also to be considered.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in outsourcing service providers:

### 2 1 Failure of a Wide Area Network (WAN)

Outsourced service providers whose services are not provided locally by the customer are highly dependent on the availability of wide area networks (WANs). For economic reasons, services are usually provided from a few central locations. The connection to the outsourcing customer takes place via wide area networks. The failure of a long-distance network can therefore lead to the outsourced service can no longer be provided.

### 2 2 Missing or inadequate information security regulations

As part of an outsourcing, outsourcing service providers receive and process large amounts of information from outsourcing customers. Depending on the protection requirements of the information to be processed, missing or inadequate regulations can cause damage, for example if responsibilities are unclear. This is the case, for example, if the regulations and instructions are not updated in the event of technical, organizational or personnel changes, such as when contact persons are changed. The range of regulatory deficits ranges from ambiguity in responsibilities and control functions to incomprehensible or incoherent formulated regulations, up to completely missing regulations.

### 2 3 Inappropriate access, access and access rights management
Depending on the outsourcing plans, it may be necessary for the outsourcing customer's employees to have access, access and access rights to IT systems, information, buildings or rooms of the outsourcing service provider. If the outsourcing service provider's procurement, administration and control of these rights are poorly regulated, this can lead to far-reaching security problems. If the processes for granting the rights are too complex, it may take too long for the employees of the outsourcing customer to receive the urgently needed rights. If IT operations grant clients too many rights, they could also gain access to areas of other clients.

### 2 4 Missing or inadequate testing and approval process

If an outsourcing service provider has not established a sufficient test and release procedure for hardware and software, this poses a considerable threat to IT operations. Existing hardware and software failures or security gaps in the configuration may not be able to do so on time recognized. Introducing new components into the operating environment without first testing them sufficiently can also result in errors or security vulnerabilities in one tenant area having a negative impact on other customers.

If inadequate testing and release procedures lead to security incidents, the necessary protection of the customer's data is no longer guaranteed and penalties or contract terminations can occur and thus have financial consequences.

### 2 5 Unsecured file and disk transport

Outsourcing service providers often process large amounts of data from the outsourcing institution. If the transport of files, documents and data carriers is not suitably secured in accordance with the protection requirements of the information to be transported, loss, unauthorized notice or manipulation can cause considerable damage to the outsourcing service provider as well as to the outsourcing service provider. This can lead to significant problems in the outsourcing business relationship. Damage can occur if files or data carriers are transported on an insecure route to the outsourcing customer and these are tapped, manipulated or lost on the way.

### 2 6 Insufficient information security management at the outsourcing service provider

Insufficiently established or inadequately implemented information security management by the outsourcing service provider entails significant risks. The issues range from a lack of overall accountability for information security to a lack of senior management support and inadequate strategic and conceptual guidance towards an intransparent security process. For outsourcing service providers, there is now the risk that the requirements of the outsourcing institution will not be met if the entire organization is deficient in terms of information security.

### 2 7 Inadequate contractual arrangements with an outsourcing customer

It may happen that, due to inadequate contractual arrangements, an outsourcing service provider does not provide a service as required to maintain the customer's security level. If the need for protection and the resulting requirements for the security of outsourced data or systems are unknown to the outsourcing service provider, they can not be adequately protected.

### 2 8 Insufficient regulations for the end of an outsourcing
Without sufficient and appropriate regulation for the termination of the outsourcing contract, there is a risk that the business relationship will not be dissolved without conflict. Thus it could happen that information of the customer is irrevocably deleted at the outsourcing service provider, before they were completely and correctly transferred to the customer. A premature cancellation of customer information may result in penalties for the service provider.

### 2 9 Inadequate emergency preparedness concept for outsourcing

If an outsourcing service provider has only an inadequate emergency preparedness concept, under certain circumstances the contractually agreed IT systems and applications may not be available or only to a limited extent in an emergency. As a result, the business processes based on this are not available and the contractually agreed service is not provided.

### 2 10 Failure of the systems of an outsourcing service provider

In the case of an outsourcing service provider, the IT systems and processes operated there can partially or completely fail, which also affects the outsourcing customer. In the case of inadequate client separation, the failure of a system that is not assigned to the outsourcing customer may mean that it can no longer call up its contractually guaranteed service. Similar problems arise when the connection between outsourcing service providers and customers fails.

This may mean for the outsourcing service provider that, if contractually agreed, the outsourcing customer can assert claims for damages.

### 2 11 Weaknesses in the connection to an outsourcing service provider

If the IT connection between the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer is insufficiently secured in an outsourcing project, the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data may be jeopardized. However, open or poorly secured interfaces could also result in unauthorized access for outsiders to the systems of the participating institutions.

### 2 12 Social Engineering

Social engineering is a way to gain unauthorized access to information or IT systems by "listening" to employees. This allows employees to be manipulated to act improperly. Employees of outsourcing service providers can make a particularly worthwhile goal here, since they have access to a great deal of data from different companies.

### 2 13 Lack of multi-client capability at the outsourcing service provider

Outsourcing service providers usually have many different customers who use the same resource base (IT systems, networks, personnel). If the IT systems and data of different customers are not sufficiently separated from one another, there is a risk that one customer will be able to access another customer's area. In addition, there could be conflicts of interest with the outsourcing customer if the service provider has to meet parallel comparable resource requirements. If the respective customers are in a competitive situation, this can be particularly problematic.
