### 1.1 Introduction

Information security management, or IS management for short, is the planning, control and monitoring task required to build and continuously implement a well-thought-out and effective information security process. A functioning security management must be embedded in the existing management structures of each institution. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to specify a security management organization structure that is directly applicable to each institution. Rather, adjustments to specific circumstances will often be required.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to demonstrate how well-functioning information security management can be set up and further developed during operation. He describes meaningful steps in a systematic security process and gives instructions for creating a comprehensive security concept.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module builds on the BSI standard 100-1 Information Security Management Systems and BSI Standard 100-2 Approach to IT Baseline Protection and summarizes the most important aspects of security management.

-----------------

Threats and vulnerabilities in the field of security management can be diverse in nature. Often they are symptom of a poor overall organization of the security process. Representing this multitude of threats and vulnerabilities, this module considers the following typical threats:

### 2 1 Lack of personal responsibility in the security process

If the roles in the security process are not clearly defined in an institution, it is likely that many employees will reject their responsibility for information security by referring to higher hierarchy levels. As a result, security measures are not implemented, since these initially almost always represent additional work in the usual workflow.

### 2 2 Lack of support from senior management

Information security officers usually do not come from the level of government or company management. Failure to fully support security officers by senior management may make it difficult to effectively require the necessary action from those in the line structure above them. In this case, the security process is not completely feasible.

### 2 3 Insufficient strategic and conceptual requirements

Although many institutions create a security concept, their content is often known only to a few insiders. This leads to the fact that the guidelines are not consciously or unconsciously adhered to in places where organizational effort would be required. If the security concept contains strategic objectives, these are often viewed as a mere collection of declarations of intent and do not provide sufficient resources for their implementation. In many cases, it is erroneously assumed that safety is automatically produced in an automated environment. Cases of damage in one's own or similarly structured institutions are sometimes the trigger for more or less vigorous actionism, in which at best partial aspects are improved at best.

### 2 4 Insufficient or misdirected investments
If the governance level of an institution is not adequately informed about the security status of business processes, IT systems and applications and about existing deficiencies, insufficient resources are made available or used improperly for the security process. In the latter case, this may mean that an excessively high level of safety in one area is faced with serious deficiencies in another area. It is also frequently observed that expensive technical security solutions are used incorrectly and thus are ineffective or even themselves become a source of danger.

### 2 5 Insufficient enforceability of security measures

Achieving a consistent and adequate level of security requires that different areas of responsibility within an institution cooperate with each other. Missing strategic statements and unclear objectives sometimes lead to different interpretations of the importance of information security. This may have the consequence that the necessary cooperation for alleged lack of necessity or insufficient prioritization of the task "information security" ultimately omitted and thus the enforceability of security measures is not given.

### 2 6 Missing update in the security process

New business processes, applications and IT systems, as well as new threats, permanently affect the status of information security within an institution. If an effective revision concept is lacking, which also strengthens the awareness of the new threats, the level of security is reduced and real security gradually becomes dangerous bogus security.

### 2 7 Breach of legal regulations and contractual agreements

If information, business processes and IT systems of an institution are insufficiently secured (for example due to inadequate security management), this may result in violations of laws related to information processing or existing contracts with business partners. Which laws have to be respected depends on the type of institution or its business processes and services. Depending on where the locations of an institution are located, different national and international regulations may have to be observed. If an institution has insufficient knowledge of international legal requirements (for example, data protection, information obligations, insolvency law, liability or information access for third parties), this increases the risk of corresponding violations. There are threats of legal consequences.

In many industries it is customary for users to oblige their suppliers and service providers to comply with certain quality and safety standards. In this context, information security requirements are also increasing. If a contracting party violates contractually regulated security requirements, this can lead to contractual penalties, but also to contract cancellations or the loss of business relationships.

### 2 8 Business disruption due to security incidents
Security incidents can be triggered by a singular event or concatenation of unfortunate circumstances that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and IT systems. This then quickly has a negative effect on essential specialist tasks and business processes of the institution concerned. Even if not all security incidents become known to the public, they can still have a negative impact on relationships with business partners and customers. It is not even the case that the most significant and far-reaching security incidents were triggered by the largest security vulnerabilities. In many cases, the chaining of small causes has led to huge damage.

### 2 9 Inefficient use of resources due to inadequate security management

Inadequate security management can lead to the setting of wrong priorities and not investing in those areas that bring the greatest added value to the institution. This can lead to the following errors:

* It invests in expensive security solutions without a base of necessary organizational regulations. Unclear responsibilities and responsibilities can lead to serious security incidents despite expensive investments.
* Investing in the areas of an information security institution that is particularly sensitive to information security. Other areas that may be more important in fulfilling the specific tasks and achieving the business goals are neglected due to scarce resources or disinterestedness of those in charge.
* It is only invested in individual areas. However, there are significant security holes in the overall system.
* By unilaterally increasing the protection of individual core values, total protection may be reduced.
* Inhomogeneous and uncoordinated use of security products can lead to high financial and human resource utilization.
