### 1.1 Introduction

Buildings form the outer physical framework for the execution of business processes. A building comprises the stationary workstations, the processed information as well as the established information technology and thus ensures an external protection for them. In addition, the infrastructure of a building often enables the execution of business processes and IT operations. Therefore, not only the building itself, so walls, ceilings, floors, roof, windows and doors to look at, but also all building-wide infrastructure and utilities such as electricity, water, gas, heating and cooling.

Considered is a building that is used by one or more organizational units of an institution. These can have quite different security requirements. In addition, it must be taken into account in all considerations that a building can and should almost always be entered by non-institutional users (citizens, customers, suppliers). If a building is used by different parties in such a way, then the design and equipment of the building and the usage concept for the building must fit together. It is intended to ensure an optimal environment for people working in the building. Unauthorized persons should not be allowed access there, where they could impair safety, and the technology deployed in the building should be safe and efficient.

### 1.2 Objective

This module describes which requirements have to be met in order to optimally use a building from the point of view of information security. The measures resulting from the requirements depend on the type and size of the institution. Requirements from this module can also be transferred to large properties with several buildings or to the use of individual parts of buildings in multi-party buildings.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module considers technical and non-technical safety aspects in the planning and use of typical buildings for companies and authorities. The entire lifecycle of buildings is considered, starting with the preparation of a catalog of requirements, over conception, installation, use to conversions or excerpt.

The cabling in a building is considered separately in the modules INF.3 Electrotechnical cabling and INF.4 IT cabling, special rooms such as server rooms or archive rooms in the respective building blocks of the INF layer.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the General Building area:

### 2 1 fire

Buildings and the people and facilities inside them can be severely damaged by fire. In addition to direct damage caused by the fire, consequential damage must also be considered. The biggest source of danger in a fire is the toxic fire smoke. Most personal injury in a fire is caused by smoke poisoning. Even at facilities and IT systems, fire smoke can cause serious damage.

For example, when PVC is burned, it produces chlorine gas, which together with the humidity and extinguishing water form hydrochloric acid. Distributing the hydrochloric acid vapors through the air conditioner can cause damage to sensitive electronic equipment located in a part of the building far from the fire.

### 2 2 Flash
Lightning is the essential hazard during a thunderstorm for buildings and the information technology contained therein. Lightning reaches currents of up to 200,000 amperes at voltages of several 100,000 volts. This enormous electrical energy is released and mined within 50-100 microseconds. A lightning strike with these values, which strikes at a distance of about 2 km, still causes power surges in the building in the building, which can lead to the destruction of sensitive electronic devices. These indirect damages increase with decreasing distance.

If the lightning strikes a building directly, the dynamic energy of the lightning causes damage. This can be damage to the building (roof and facade), damage caused by fires or overvoltage damage to electrical equipment.

### 2 3 water

Water can cause damage to a building and its facilities from the outside, for example from rain, flood or floods, or from the inside, for example from defects in water pipes.

### 2 4 Natural damage and natural disasters

Depending on the location of a building, it is exposed to varying degrees of risk from natural disasters and natural disasters. Causes of natural disasters can be seismic, climatic or volcanic phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, tsunamis, avalanches and volcanic eruptions. Examples of extreme meteorological phenomena are severe weather, hurricanes or cyclones.

### 2 5 Environmental hazards

Buildings may be damaged or impaired by events in the immediate area, such as the immediate emergence of toxic substances or, indirectly, rescues, road closures or evacuations.

### 2 6 Unauthorized access

If unauthorized persons enter a building or individual premises, this can result in various other security threats. Unauthorized persons can cause damage through intentional acts such as theft or manipulation of information or IT systems, but also through unintentional misconduct (eg due to lack of expertise).

The aim of a burglary may be the theft of IT components or other readily available goods, as well as the copying or manipulation of data or IT systems. Non-obvious manipulations can cause much higher damage than direct destruction. Even unauthorized intrusion can cause property damage. Windows and doors are forcibly opened and damaged, they must be repaired or replaced.

### 2 7 Violation of laws or regulations

When constructing buildings, a large number of laws and regulations must be observed, for example relating to fire protection or other aspects of structural safety. If it is violated, it may not be noticeable for a long time, but it can have catastrophic consequences if, for example, fireboards were improperly installed.

### 2 8 Insufficient firing

Every building in which IT operates is criss-crossed by a multitude of wires and cables. Fresh and sewer pipes, heating pipes, energy supply and data transmission are mentioned as examples. It is inevitable that such pipe and cable routes must cross fire walls and floors. If suitable fire barriers are not installed in such places, fires and smoke may spread uncontrollably.
The high dynamics of the IT also make it necessary to relocate, even beyond the firebox, in the pipeline network. In what form that can be done correctly depends directly on the existing bulkhead and can be very different. If changes to a firewall are not carried out in accordance with the requirements of the respective bulkhead manufacturer, there is a risk that it will fail in the event of a fire and the fire can thus expand into the area actually protected by the bulkhead.

### 2 9 Power failure

In the event of a power outage, entire buildings or parts of them may become unusable. Not only the obvious, direct power consumers such as IT or lighting are dependent on the power supply, also all infrastructure facilities are today directly or indirectly dependent on the electricity, eg. As elevators, air conditioning, security systems, security locks, automatic door locking systems, sprinkler systems, telephone extension systems. Even the water supply is dependent on electricity in high or low floors because of the pumps required to generate pressure.
