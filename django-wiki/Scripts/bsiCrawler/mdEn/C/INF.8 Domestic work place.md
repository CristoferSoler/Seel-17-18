### 1.1 Introduction

Teleworkers, freelancers or the self-employed typically work from home-based workplaces. In contrast to the workplace in an office environment, employees at a home workplace * * use a workplace in their own living environment. It must be made possible that the professional sphere is sufficiently separated from the private sphere. If employees use domestic jobs on a permanent basis, various legal requirements must be met, for example, the workplaces must comply with occupational health and ergonomic regulations.

A home-based workplace can not assume the same infrastructural security as is found in the offices of an institution. For example, often the workplace is also accessible to visitors or family members. Therefore, measures must be taken to achieve a level of security comparable to an office space.

### 1.2 Objective

This module shows how the infrastructure of a home-based workplace can be safely set up and operated. The core objective of the module is to protect the information of the institution at the home workplace.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module contains basic requirements that must be observed and fulfilled in order to be able to counteract specific hazards to a home-based workplace. However, only specific infrastructure requirements for a fixed workplace with access by third parties are defined. However, security requirements for the IT systems used (eg computers) and in particular for the technical components of teleworking (eg communication links) are not the subject of this module but are described in OPS.1.2.4 * Telework * and described in the respective system-specific building blocks.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance to a home-based workplace:

### 2 1 Lack of or inadequate regulations for the home office

Since a home-based workplace is located outside the institution, the employees there are largely on their own. As a result, lack of or inadequate regulations for the home-based workplace environment can create IT issues with increased downtime. For example, if IT issues can not be resolved remotely, an IT supervisor from the institution will first have to go to work at home to solve the problem. If the handling of internal and confidential information at the home office is not comprehensibly regulated, it could happen that employees keep this information wrong. This may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the information, as it can not sufficiently prevent information from being spied out or modified.

### 2 2 Unauthorized access to vulnerable areas of the home workplace

Rooms in a home-based workplace where sensitive information is kept and processed, or where vulnerable equipment is located, become vulnerable spaces. If unauthorized persons can enter these rooms unattended, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data and information located there is considerably jeopardized.

** Examples **

* One employee had set up a separate study at home but did not complete it consistently. When the toddlers were left unattended, they played in the unfastened study. Important documents were used as a basis for painting.
* When a coworker at the domestic workplace was engrossed in a project work, he got a surprising visit. While he was making coffee in the kitchen, the visitor wanted to do some quick research on the computer while the computer was not locked up and inadvertently infected it with malicious software.
### 2 3 Impairment of IT use due to unfavorable working conditions at home

A non-ergonomic home-based workplace or an unfavorable working environment can result in undisturbed work or a lack of optimal use of IT. The disturbances range from noise or heavy traffic to unfavorable lighting and poor ventilation. As a result, work processes are restricted and employee potential is used insufficiently. There may also be errors in the work, the integrity of data can be reduced.

### 2 4 Unsecured file and disk transport

When documents, media or files are transported between the institution and the home office, there is a risk that this data and information will be lost or stolen, read or manipulated by unauthorized third parties. File and disk transport can be insufficiently secured in several ways:

* If unique items are transported (missing backup), goals and tasks can not be achieved as planned after loss.
* If unencrypted data carriers fall into the wrong hands, this can lead to serious confidentiality losses.
* If insufficient access protection is available on the way, files or data carriers can be copied or manipulated unnoticed.
### 2 5 Unsuitable disposal of data media and documents

If employees at the domestic workplace are not able to dispose of data media and documents appropriately, there is a risk that they will be thrown into the household waste. However, attackers can gain valuable information that can be misused specifically for blackmail or industrial espionage. The consequences range from the loss of know-how to the threat to the existence of the institution, for example, if important orders fail to materialize or partnerships fail.

### 2 6 Manipulation or destruction of IT, accessories, information and software at the home office

IT equipment, accessories, information, and software used at the home workplace may be easier to manipulate or destroy than at the institution. The home office is often accessible to customers, relatives and family visitors. Also here the central protective measures of the institution are not present, for example, porter services. When manipulating or destroying IT equipment, accessories, information, or software, employees often have limited ability to work at home. In addition, it may be necessary to replace destroyed IT components, information and software solutions, which requires both financial and time resources.

### 2 7 Danger by cleaning or external personnel

Cleaning and contracting personnel can jeopardize internal information, business processes and IT systems in various ways, ranging from improper handling of technical equipment, through attempts to "play" with IT systems, to theft of documents or IT components. For example, by cleaning personnel accidentally a plug connection can be solved, get water in the IT, documents laid or even removed with the waste.

### 2 8 Increased theft risk at the home workplace
The home office is usually not as well secured as the workplace in a company or agency. By more elaborate precautions (eg security doors, porter service) there is the danger that someone will enter the building without authorization, much less than with a private home. Burglars mostly steal items that are quick and easy to sell. It can also be stolen official IT. However, the information available on the stolen official IT systems often has a higher value than the IT systems themselves. Burglars could try to obtain a higher profit by extorting or distributing the data to competing companies than by selling the hardware.
