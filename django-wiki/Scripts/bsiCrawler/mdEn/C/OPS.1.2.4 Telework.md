### 1.1 Introduction

Teleworking is understood as any activity based on information and communication technology, which is carried out exclusively outside the business premises and buildings of the employer. There are different forms of teleworking. It can, for example, be provided as home-based teleworking in the employee's home. It is also possible that the employees are employed in the context of the on-site teleworking with customers or suppliers and work there with the equipment of the own employer. Another possibility is teleworking in so-called telecentres, satellite or neighborhood offices.

Homebased telework distinguishes between home-based work and alternating teleworking. In the case of alternating teleworking, employees work alternately at their workplace at the employer's workplace and at home.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of the module is to protect the information stored, processed and transmitted during teleworking. For this purpose, typical hazards are identified and specific requirements for teleworking are defined.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module focuses on the forms of telework that are carried out in part or entirely in the home environment. It is assumed that there is a telecommunication link between the teleworking center and the institution, which makes it possible to exchange information and, if necessary, to access data in the institution. The requirements of this module cover three different areas:

* the organization of telework,
* teleworker's teleworker and
* the communication link between teleworker and institution.
Safety requirements for the teleworking center infrastructure are not taken into account in this module, but are described in module INF.8 * Domestic workstation *. The requirements of the topic-overlapping module INF.10 * Mobile workstation * must be observed.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the *** *** teleworking area:

### 2 1 Missing or inadequate regulations for the teleworking station

Since a teleworking station is located outside the institution, it requires individually adapted organizational arrangements. If such regulations do not exist, employees may not know that they B. independently have to perform backups. Also, they may not know how to deal with security-related incidents at the teleworkstation. For example, if confidential information gets into someone else's hands, it may be used by unauthorized persons as a serious disadvantage of the institution.

### 2 2 Lack of or insufficient training of teleworkers

Teleworkers are largely on their own at work. If the teleworker is not adequately trained in the handling of IT, this can lead to increased downtime in the event of problems, since, for example, an IT supervisor from the institution must first drive to the teleworkstation in order to eliminate the problems there.

### 2 3 Unauthorized private use of the official teleworking computer

In the home, it is easier to use the official teleworking computer privately, because controls by the employer are only partially possible. Therefore, it can happen that unchecked and released software is used and by careless action malicious software reaches the teleworking computer. This could, for example, compromise confidential information.
But not only teleworkers can use their computer improperly, but also relatives or visitors. Damage such as deleted hard drives can result in reinstallation costs or re-capture work.

### 2 4 Delays due to temporarily limited availability of teleworkers

Usually, a teleworker has no fixed working hours at the teleworkstation. Only fixed times are agreed when it must be reachable. In the case of alternating teleworking, his working hours are also distributed between the teleworkstation and the in-house workplace.

If it is necessary for information to be obtained from the teleworker at short notice or for information to be passed on to the teleworker, delays may occur due to the difficult accessibility. Even if the information is sent via e-mail, it does not necessarily shorten the response time since it can not be guaranteed that the teleworker will read the e-mail in a timely manner.

Delays due to temporarily limited accessibility of teleworkers can have different effects depending on the situation and institution and limit the availability.

### 2 5 Poor integration of the teleworker in the flow of information

Since teleworkers are not in the institution on a daily basis, they have less opportunity to participate in the direct exchange of information with supervisors and work colleagues. As a result, they can be isolated from operational events and thereby z. B. identify less with the institution. Lack of information can also result in errors in workflows and operational processes that limit the teleworker's productivity. If the flow of information to the teleworker is not guaranteed, important news on information security may not reach him in time.

### 2 6 Insufficient representation rules for teleworking

The tasks of the teleworker are usually designed so that he can work independently for the most part. This can make it difficult in the case of illness to provide a representation for the teleworker. In particular, there may be problems in providing the requisite documentation or teleworker data to the representative when there are no access to the teleworker's home office.

### 2 7 Non-compliance with safety measures

Especially at the teleworkplace it may be due to lack of control options that employees do not or not fully implement recommended or ordered security measures. It may cause damage that would otherwise be prevented or at least reduced. Depending on the function of the employee and the importance of the disregarded measure even serious damage can occur, eg. For example, confidential information can fall into the wrong hands. These may then be used to the serious disadvantage of the institution.
