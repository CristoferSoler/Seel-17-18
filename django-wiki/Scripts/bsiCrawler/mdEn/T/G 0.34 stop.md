An attack can threaten an institution, certain areas of the institution or individuals. The technical possibilities to carry out an attack are manifold: thrown bricks, explosion by explosives, firearms use, arson. Whether and to what extent an institution is exposed to the danger of an attack depends not only on the location and the environment of the building, but also on its tasks and the political-social climate. Companies and authorities operating in politically controversial areas are more threatened than others. Institutions in the vicinity of conventional demonstration staging areas are more at risk than those in remote locations. In Germany, the Land Criminal Police Offices or the Federal Criminal Police Office can be consulted in order to assess the threat or suspected threats from politically motivated attacks.

Examples:

* In the 1980s, a bomb attack on the data center of a large federal authority in Cologne was committed. The explosive power of the explosive device not only destroyed windows and walls, but also many IT systems in the data center.
* The attack on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001 not only killed many people, but also destroyed many IT facilities. As a result, several companies have had considerable difficulty continuing their business activities.
