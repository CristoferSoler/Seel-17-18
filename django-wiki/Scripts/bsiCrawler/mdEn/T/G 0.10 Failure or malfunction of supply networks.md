G 0.10 Failure or malfunction of supply networks
=================================================

There are a number of networks in a building that provide basic supply and disposal and thus serve as the basis for all business processes of an institution, including IT. Examples of such utility networks are:

* Electricity,
* Phone,
* Cooling,
* Heating or ventilation,
* Water and sewage,
* Fire water supplies,
* Gas,
* Reporting and control systems (eg for burglary, fire, home automation technology) and
* Intercoms.
The failure or disruption of a supply network can, among other things, mean that people can no longer work in the building or that the IT operation and thus the information processing is impaired.

The networks are dependent on each other in different degrees, so that malfunctions in each individual network can also affect others.

** Examples **

* A failure of heating or ventilation can result in all employees having to leave the affected buildings. This can potentially cause high damage.
* The failure of the power supply affects not only the IT directly, but also on all other networks, which are equipped with electrically operated control technology. Even in drains, electric lift pumps may be present.
* Failure of the water supply may affect the operation of air conditioners.
