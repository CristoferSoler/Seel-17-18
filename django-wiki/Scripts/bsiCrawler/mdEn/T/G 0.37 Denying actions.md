G 0.37 Denying actions
================================

Individuals may deny having committed certain acts for a variety of reasons, such as violating instructions, security policies, or even laws. But you could also deny having received a notification, for example because you forgot an appointment. In the field of information security, therefore, liability is often highlighted, a quality that seeks to ensure that actions taken can not be unduly denied. In English-speaking countries, the term non-repudiation is used.

In the case of communication, a distinction is additionally made as to whether a communication participant rejects the message reception (Repudiation of Receipt) or the dispatch (Repudiation of Origin). Refusing to receive messages may be of importance, inter alia, in financial transactions, e.g. For example, if someone denies having received an invoice in time. Likewise, a communication participant may deny message delivery, e.g. So a denied order denies. Message delivery or receipt can be denied during the mailing as well as when using fax or e-mail.

Example:

* A much-needed spare part is ordered electronically. After a week, the lack is claimed, in the meantime high costs have been incurred by the loss of production. The supplier denies having ever received an order.
