G 0.24 Destruction of equipment or data carriers
===============================================

Negligence, improper use, but also untrained handling can lead to destruction of devices and data carriers that can seriously disrupt the operation of the IT system.

There is also the danger that the destruction will destroy important information that can not be reconstructed or can only be reconstructed with great effort.

Examples:

* Inside a company, an innate user used to know that an important server is sensitive to high operating temperatures, and blocked the power slots on the power supply fan with an item hidden behind the server. Two days later, the hard disk in the server suffered a temperature-related defect, and the server failed for several days.
* One employee had been so annoyed with the system's repeated crashes that he vented his anger on his workstation. Here, the hard drive was so badly damaged by kicks against the computer that it was unusable. The data stored here could only partially be reconstructed by a backup from the previous day.
* Injured coffee cups or moisture entering the flower can cause short circuits in an IT system.
