G 0.31 Incorrect use or administration of devices and systems
================================================== =====================

Improper or improper use of equipment, systems and applications may compromise their safety, especially if existing security measures are disregarded or circumvented. This often leads to disruptions or failures. Depending on which types of devices or systems are misused, however, the confidentiality and integrity of information may also be violated.

A particularly important special case of incorrect use is incorrect administration. Failure to install, configure, maintain, and maintain hardware or software components can cause serious damage.

For example, excessively assigned rights, easy-to-guess passwords, insufficiently protected volumes with backup copies, or terminals that are not locked during temporary absence can lead to security incidents.

Likewise, erroneous operation of IT systems or applications can also accidentally erase or modify data. However, confidential information could also be made public, for example if access rights are set incorrectly.

If power or power cables are laid unprotected, they may be inadvertently damaged, causing connections to fail. Equipment connection cables can be torn out when employees or visitors stumble over it.
