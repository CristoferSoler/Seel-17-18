G 0.44 Unauthorized intrusion into premises
==============================================

If unauthorized persons enter a building or individual premises, this can entail various other dangers. These include, for example, theft or manipulation of information or IT systems. In the case of qualified attacks, the time period in which the perpetrators can pursue their goal undisturbed is decisive.

Often the perpetrators want to steal valuable IT components or other goods that can be easily divested. One of the purposes of a burglary, however, may be to obtain confidential information, to manipulate or to disrupt business processes.

The unauthorized intrusion into premises can thus cause several types of damage:

* Even the unauthorized intrusion can cause property damage. Windows and / or doors are forcibly opened and damaged, they must be repaired or replaced.
* Stolen, damaged or destroyed equipment or components must be repaired or replaced.
* Damage may result from violation of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information or applications.
Examples:

* Vandalism
* During a break-in to a business on a weekend, only minor damage was done by prying open a window, only a coffee pot and smaller furnishings were stolen. However, during a routine check it was later discovered that a central server was cleverly manipulated at the time of the break-in.
