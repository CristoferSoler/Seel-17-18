### 1.1 Introduction

The secure processing of information is of vital importance for almost all companies and authorities. This information can be stored both on paper, in computers or in heads. To protect the information, it is not enough to use only technical security solutions. An appropriate level of security can only be achieved and maintained through the planned and organized action of all stakeholders. Prerequisite for the meaningful implementation and success control of security measures is a systematic approach. This planning, steering and control task is referred to as information security management or also briefly as IS management or security management.

A functioning security management must be embedded in the existing management structures of each institution. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to specify a security management organization structure that is directly applicable to each institution. Rather, adjustments to specific circumstances will often be required.

### 1.2 Life cycle

In the context of security management, a series of measures have to be implemented, beginning with the conception, through the development of suitable organizational structures, up to the regular revision. The steps to be taken and the actions to follow in each step are listed below. One of the cornerstones for achieving an adequate level of security is that the management level is behind the security objectives and aware of its responsibility for information security. The management level must initiate, control and monitor the security process so that it is implemented in the organization in all areas (see ISMS.1.M1 Assumption of overall responsibility for information security by the management level).

Furthermore, a continuous security process must be established and a security strategy appropriate for the respective institution must be defined (see ISMS.1.M2 Definition of the security objectives and strategy). As with all other security questions, the management level must appoint a person as the main responsible person (see ISMS.1.M4 Appointment of an Information Security Officer). It is responsible for setting up and maintaining an appropriate information security organizational structure (see ISMS.1.M6 Building an Appropriate Information Security Organizational Structure). As one of the first actions, an information security guideline should be developed (see ISMS.1.M3, Guidance on Information Security).

Information security must be practiced in all areas of the institution (see ISMS.1.M9 Integrating Information Security into Organization-wide Processes and Processes). In addition to the elaboration of a security concept (see ISMS.1.M10 Creation of a security concept), this also includes the integration of the employees in the security process (see ISMS.1.M8 Integration of the employees in the security process) as well as the creation of target group-oriented security policies (see ISMS. 1.M14 Creation of target group oriented security policies).

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the area of ​​"Security Management".

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### ISMS.1.M1 Assumption of overall responsibility for information security by the management level [Institutional Management]
The leadership and direction of a company or a public agency and the associated management tasks involve a high level of responsibility. This responsibility not only relates to the degree of goal achievement, such as business success, but also to the early detection and minimization of potential operational risks. These include, among other risks, those resulting from inadequate information security.

It is a complex task to ensure a lasting level of security. This requires a systematic approach, a continuous and targeted security process. It is up to the management level of each institution to initiate, steer and control this process. For smaller institutions, this is often done personally by a member of the management level. In medium and large institutions, the information security task is delegated to a dedicated person, the information security officer. Depending on the size and type of institution, additional persons are entrusted with security tasks, which they perform exclusively or in addition to other tasks. The overall responsibility always remains with the management level, regardless of how many people have been delegated security tasks.

The management must be informed regularly about possible risks and consequences due to a lack of information security. It is advisable to draw the attention of management to the following points:

* Presentation of security risks and the associated effects and costs
* Impact of security incidents on critical business processes
* Legal and contractual safety requirements
* Overview of standard information security practices for the industry
Although the management level is responsible for achieving the security objectives, the security process must be supported and co-designed by all employees in an institution. Therefore, the following principles should be adhered to:

* Assuming overall responsibility for information security
 The initiative for information security is based on the authorities or company management. The task "Information Security" is actively supported by the authorities or company management.
* Integrate information security
 Information security must be integrated into all processes and projects. In addition, all parties involved in the security process must be sufficiently informed and motivated to comply with them.
* Define responsibilities
 The authorities designate the information security staff and equip them with the necessary skills and resources.
* Steer and monitor
 The management level must actively initiate, steer and monitor the security process. To do this, management must be aware of the impact of security incidents on business operations, set security goals, and create framework conditions that will enable them to achieve those goals.
* Set reasonable goals
 Absolute information security does not exist. Therefore, it is important to set the security goals so that they are achievable on the one hand with a reasonable effort (staff, time, financial resources) and on the other hand the security risks are reduced to an acceptable level.
* Role model function
 The management level also assumes an exemplary role in the area of ​​information security. This includes, among other things, that the management level also complies with all specified safety rules. The management level must demonstrate information security.
* Continuous improvement
The adequacy and effectiveness of all elements of safety management must be constantly reviewed. Identified weaknesses and opportunities for improvement must be resolutely resolved or implemented. It is also important to recognize future developments, changed framework conditions and potential threats at an early stage.
* Communication and knowledge
 Leadership and the IS management team must motivate employees and provide adequate training and awareness-raising. Employees must above all be informed about the meaning and purpose of both technical security measures and organizational requirements. Users should be involved in the implementation planning of measures. This allows them to contribute ideas and assess the practicality of safety measures.
#### ISMS.1.M2 Definition of security objectives and strategy [Institutional Management]

Information security is an important factor for success in order to fulfill the goals and tasks of a company or public authority. Information security is not a one-time project, but a continuous process that must be anchored as such in all business processes and the minds of all employees. The security process must be initiated, established and controlled by the authorities or company management. First, adequate security objectives and an information security strategy must be established. In addition to the strategic key statements, conceptual requirements must be developed and the organizational framework created to enable the proper and secure handling of information within all business processes of the company or the authority.

The security objectives should be carefully determined at the beginning of each security process. Otherwise, there is a risk that security concepts will be developed that do not meet the information security requirements of the authority or the company. The information security methodological planning helps to achieve the basic goals and tasks of a company or a public authority. The basis for the definition of the security objectives is therefore the general objectives of the institution as well as the essential business processes and information. Adequate and achievable security goals are a prerequisite for all further steps in the security process. The goals must be realistic, practical, convincing and understandable. From this, the security concept can then be used to derive the protection required by the individual information, business processes, applications, IT components and networks, and which security measures must therefore be implemented.

When implementing security measures, a compromise between cost and effort usually has to be found. It should therefore be transparent which information and business processes contribute to the performance of the task and what value is assigned to them in order to formulate appropriate security goals.

The security objectives must be borne and held responsible by the management of the company or the authorities. They should be developed and documented by the information security management team with the involvement of senior management. Depending on the organizational structure, it is advisable to include the heads of larger business units (eg department heads or area managers) in the consultations.

A detailed description of how and in which depth the security strategy and objectives should be recorded can be found in the BSI standard 100-2 Approach to IT-Grundschutz.
Security objectives and strategy need to be reviewed regularly to see if they are up to date and appropriate. In particular, changes in basic conditions, business processes or the IT environment, the security objectives and strategy must be reviewed and possibly adjusted.

The security process can only be successful in the long term if the effectiveness and efficiency of the security strategy is regularly reviewed by senior management. The resulting improvements go into the adaptation of the security process.

#### ISMS.1.M3 Creation of an information security guideline [Head of Institution]

The security strategy messages need to be summarized in an information security guideline to document the security objectives to be followed and the desired level of security for all employees. With the security guideline, the public authorities / management commit themselves visibly to their responsibility for information security.

When compiling the information security guideline, the following points should be noted:

** Responsibility of the authorities or management **

It is important that the authorities and management are fully in line with the information security guideline and its goals. Therefore, the security policy must be signed by the authorities or management and published on their behalf. Even if individual tasks are delegated to persons or organizational units as part of the security process, the overall responsibility for information security always remains with the authorities or company management.

** Definition of scope **

The information security policy needs to describe which areas it should apply to. The scope may include or consist of parts of the entire institution. However, it is important that the specialist tasks and business processes considered are completely included in the scope of application.

** Definition of security goals **

At the beginning of the security process, the authorities or management must define, coordinate and document the security objectives. These can be derived from business processes and specialist tasks, legal framework conditions and general government or corporate goals. The security objectives serve as the basis for the creation of the information security guideline.

** Content of the security guideline **

The information security guideline should be succinctly formulated, as more than 20 pages have not been tried and tested in practice. It should, however, include at least the following aspects:

* The importance of information security and the importance of essential information, business processes and IT for the institution must be demonstrated.
* The security objectives and the relation of the security objectives to the business objectives and tasks of the institution must be explained.
* The core elements of the security strategy should be mentioned.
* The management level must demonstrate to all employees that the security policy is borne and enforced by them. Likewise, there must be lead statements for success review.
* The organizational structure established for the implementation of the security process must be described.
** Announcement of the information security guideline **
Safety measures and organizational regulations are only followed by all employees if they recognize their purpose. The security policy must therefore be published in order to document the strategy of responsible management. This should be done so that the importance of information security becomes clear. It is important that all employees know and understand the contents of the security policy. New staff should be made aware of the information security guideline before they can access business-related information. If all employees have to confirm the knowledge of the security guideline in writing, their importance is underlined. In general, the information security guideline should be kept general enough to appeal to all employees in the different organizational areas of an institution. However, it is also possible to supplement the security guideline for specific applications or areas within an institution with content that is relevant only to a limited group of persons or that is confidential. It is advisable to move these sections to an annex to the guideline so that it can respond more flexibly and in a timely manner to necessary changes without having to adapt the general part of the guideline. If necessary, the system may be separately marked as confidential and specially protected.

** Security Guideline Update **

The information security guideline should be reviewed at regular intervals for its up-to-dateness and adjusted if necessary. Changes in framework conditions, business goals, tasks or security strategy should be incorporated. In the often rapid developments in both IT and security, it is recommended that the security guideline be revised every two years and made known to all employees again.

#### ISMS.1.M4 Appointment of an Information Security Officer [Head of Institution]

In any institution, regardless of size, type or industry, a person must be designated as an information security officer. He is responsible for all aspects of information security. The duties of the Information Security Officer include:

* control and coordinate the information security process,
* to support the management level in the preparation of the information security guideline,
* co-ordinate the creation of the security concept, the emergency preparedness concept and other sub-concepts and system security policies, as well as adopting further information security policies and regulations;
* prepare the implementation plan for the security measures and initiate and verify their implementation,
* to report to the management level and the IS management team on the status quo of information security,
* coordinate security-related projects and ensure the flow of information between area IT, project and IT system security officers,
* to investigate security-related incidents as well
* To initiate and control awareness-raising and training on information security.
The Information Security Officer must be involved in all major projects that have a significant impact on information processing, as well as in the introduction of new applications and IT systems, to ensure that security-relevant aspects are adequately addressed. These include z. For example, the procurement of IT systems or the design of IT-based business processes.

The Information Security Officer must be able to report directly to the senior management if necessary. To ensure this, it is advisable to set up this role as a staff unit.
In small institutions, the function of information security officer can also be performed by a qualified employee, among other tasks. The decisive factor is that the information security officer is given sufficient time for his tasks. Especially when setting up the security process for the first time, sufficient time resources must be planned for this purpose. Also, when planning the information security organization, a qualified representative of the information security officer must be named.

** Information Security Officer Selection **

The Information Security Officer must be adequately qualified and have sufficient opportunity to receive further training. He should have knowledge and experience in the fields of information security and information technology. He should also have the following qualifications and characteristics:

* Overview of tasks and goals of the institution
* Identification with the objectives of information security
* Cooperation and teamwork (few other tasks require so much skill and skill in dealing with other people)
* Ability to work independently
* Assertiveness
* Experience in project management
#### ISMS.1.M5 Contract design when ordering an external information security officer [Institutional Management]

If an external information security officer is appointed, the following instructions should be observed.

In particular, in small companies or public authorities, it may be appropriate not to fill the role of information security officer by a separate employee, but to use the services of an external information security officer. To do this, you must first select a suitable, qualified information security expert. Information about the necessary qualifications, the function and the tasks of an information security officer can be found in the BSI Standard 100-2 and in the action ISMS.1.M4 Appointment of an Information Security Officer.

Before appointing an external information security officer, a contract must be concluded between the service provider and his own institution, in which the tasks of the external information security officer and the mutual rights and obligations must be regulated as precisely as possible. It is important to ensure that the contract includes a suitable confidentiality agreement. The assignment of an external information security officer is thus a special form of outsourcing.

The following aspects should at least be regulated in the contract:

* Requirements for the qualification of the external information security officer
* Representation rules and minimum resources
* Tasks that the external information security officer must undertake
* Reporting, reporting and escalation routes, contact persons (roles)
* Integration in communication channels of the commissioning institution
* Locations, premises and availability / availability times
* Access, access and access rights
* Lecture rights and reporting obligations to the management level of the commissioning institution
* Obligation to cooperate of the client
* Confidentiality agreement
* Conflicts of interest
* Consequences of contract violations
* Regulations for the termination of the contractual relationship, eg. B. Transfer of tasks and documents
* Costs
The contract requires the external information security officer to be required and able to perform his duties at least as well as an internal ISB. In addition, the contract must enable a controlled termination of the contractual relationship, including the transfer of tasks to the client.
If the service of an external information security officer is used, the module OPS.2.1 Outsourcing usage must also be used. Particular attention should be paid here to the regulations for the use of external personnel.

#### ISMS.1.M6 Establishment of a suitable organizational structure for information security [Head of Institution]

The following describes the aspects to consider when building an appropriate information security organizational structure.

** Planning and Establishing the Information Security Organization **

In order to successfully plan and implement a security process as well as to maintain and continuously improve it, there must be a suitable organizational structure for information security. It must be defined roles that perform the various tasks to achieve the security objectives. In addition, persons must be named who are qualified and who have sufficient resources to complete these roles.

At the beginning of a security process, it may turn out that while the organization already identifies people responsible for various aspects of information security, there is no overall structure for information security. In this case, an appropriate, comprehensive organizational structure for information security must be established.

If an IS organization has already been established, it should be considered on a regular basis whether this is still appropriate or needs to be adapted to new framework conditions.

** Function of Information Security Officer **

The nature and characteristics of an information security organization depend on the size, nature and structure of the institution. However, the role of the Information Security Officer must be established in each institution, as he is responsible for all information security matters. It must be named a person who plays this role. It is not necessary for this purpose to create a specific position in the institution. B. also an external ISB can be commissioned.

An information security officer alone can not provide adequate security in all areas of an institution. Therefore, communication and presentation skills are important. The management level must always be involved in central questions of the security process, and decisions must also be demanded. Collaboration with employees as well as with outsiders requires a lot of skill as they need to be convinced of the need for (sometimes a bit annoying) security measures. At least as sensitive is the questioning of employees about safety-critical occurrences and weak points. To achieve meaningful results in these surveys, employees must be confident that honest answers are not used against them.

** Building an Information Security Management Team **

In larger institutions, it makes sense to build an IS management team that supports the information security officer and oversees all overarching information security concerns and develops plans, guidelines and guidelines.

The size and composition of the IS management team should be defined according to the scope of the security process and the resources and expertise required. The BSI standard 100-2 IT-Grundschutz Approach presents various variants of what an organizational structure of information security management can look like.

** Selection of the IS management team **

To consider the different layers of information security in an institution, the following representatives should work together in the IS management team:

* Information Security Officer
* IT managers
* User representatives
* Data Protection Officer
If necessary, representatives of the audit, the judiciary, the staff representation and the management level of the institution should be consulted.

** Appointment of a responsible manager **

At the management level, the information security task should be clearly assigned to a responsible manager to whom the information security officer reports directly. In small institutions, even a managing director can take on this task.

** Definition of responsibilities (separation of functions) **

Responsibilities and competencies within the information security organization (or IS organization for short) must be clearly defined and assigned. In addition, substitution regulations must be ensured for all important functions.

** Definition of communication channels **

Communication channels must be planned, described, set up and made public. It must be determined for all tasks and roles, who informs whom, who is informed about which actions and to what extent this has to be done.

** Review of information security organization **

A once-structured IS organization is not static. Business processes and environmental conditions are constantly changing, so that the IS organization has to be constantly reconsidered. For example, it should be examined whether the tasks and competencies within the security process were sufficiently clearly defined, but also whether the tasks planned could be carried out as planned. Above all, the following points are important:

* Monitoring responsibilities during operation
 It has to be checked on a regular basis, if all responsibilities and responsibilities have been clearly assigned and they are practicable.
* Verification of compliance
 It must be checked regularly whether all processes and processes of the IS organization are used and implemented as planned. At the same time, it should be ensured that the established organizational structures for information security meet the requirements.
* Assessment of the efficiency of processes and organizational regulations
 It must be regularly checked whether processes and organizational regulations of safety management are practicable and efficient.
 As soon as processes or regulations that have been set up for security reasons are too complicated or time-consuming, they are often ignored or deliberately bypassed despite the risk of security incidents.
* Management ratings
 The management must be regularly informed about the results of the above-mentioned reviews. Not only are the reports necessary to solve urgent or time-critical issues, they also provide important information that management needs to manage the security process.
** Customize and Improve Information Security Organization **

The IS organization must be regularly optimized for efficiency and effectiveness. If weaknesses have appeared in the processes or regulations for the IS organization, these must be eliminated.

**Documentation**

The tasks, responsibilities and competencies in security management must be comprehensibly documented. This includes the essential work instructions and organizational regulations.

#### ISMS.1.M7 Definition of security measures

From the general security objectives and the identified protection requirements, concrete security measures are derived according to the considered information network. In order to derive concrete security measures from the security requirements of the IT-Grundschutz modules, concrete components of the IT-Grundschutz catalogs for the security requirements of an information network must be selected in order to obtain a specific package of security measures as a target specification.
The security concept must describe the period in which the individual measures are to be implemented and which can be combined and implemented in a suitable combination. In addition, measures must be prioritized according to the urgency of implementation.

When selecting security measures, their suitability and cost-effectiveness must also be taken into account. It must be understandable why the selected measures are likely to meet the safety objectives and requirements. The documentation should therefore contain specific information on responsibilities and responsibilities as well as planned activities for inspection, audit, monitoring.

The security measures should be described in sufficient detail so that a third party can assume security-related tasks in the case of substitution.

#### ISMS.1.M8 Integration of employees into the security process [supervisors]

Information security affects all employees without exception. Each individual must help through responsible and quality-conscious action to avoid damage and to contribute to the success of the institution. The integration of employees into the security process includes the following tasks:

** motivation and working conditions **

The authorities or management must create a positive working environment and encourage employee engagement for information security. These include the following aspects:

* Use appropriate and easy-to-use security products.
* Security concepts and policies must be realistic.
* Information security must be practiced by senior management to ensure a high level of employee acceptance.
#### ISMS.1.M9 Integrating Information Security into Organizational Procedures and Processes [Institutional Management]

Information security must be integrated into all business processes. It must be ensured that not only new projects but also current ones take into account all the necessary safety aspects.

Especially in larger institutions there is often already an overall risk management system. Operational risks, including IT risks, are an integral part of risk management. Information security is also a fundamental and cross-process requirement for institutions. Therefore, the methods of managing information security risks should be aligned with established risk management methods. It is important that work instructions or service agreements from different areas of an institution should not contradict each other. Work instructions and service agreements must not conflict with applicable safety measures.

The BSI Standard 100-2 on the IT-Grundschutz Approach and the building blocks of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogs contain requirements for the organization of the security process. In the following, for example, important overarching security measures are briefly mentioned:

** Assignment of responsibility for business processes, information, applications and IT systems **

Responsible persons must be named for all essential business processes, information, IT systems and applications, but also for buildings and rooms. Depending on the area and language use these responsible persons z. B. referred to as information owner, business process manager or specialist responsible. The specialists have to support the development and implementation of the security strategy.

** Integration of employees in the security process **
Information security affects all employees without exception. Each individual must help by responsible and quality-conscious action to avoid damage, and contribute to success. This does not only apply to permanent employees, but to all those employed within the institution, including, for example, gatekeepers and interns.

Likewise, people who access business processes, applications or IT systems from outside should also be included. B. mobile employees. Important safety measures that have to be taken into account in personnel management, ie starting with personnel selection and recruitment through to switching to other areas or leaving the institution, are described in the ORP.2 Personnel building block.

In addition, all employees within their area of ​​responsibility must be instructed in the required security measures. They should be made aware of safety issues on a regular basis to raise awareness of risks and safeguards in everyday information handling. Management also needs to be involved in the awareness-raising concept. More detailed explanations can be found in the module ORP.3 Sensitization and Information Security Training.

** Integration of external service providers in the security process **

Security management should have an overview of all types of service providers performing tasks for the institution. These can be services that directly affect the processing of business-related information, such as the operation of a data center, but also general support services such as security. It does not matter at which location the service is provided (institution or service provider).

Security management should assess for each service provider whether their activity can have security implications and what security measures should be taken in this context. If IT systems, applications or business processes are outsourced to an external service provider, the module OPS.2.1 Outsourcing Use must be applied. The security concept must also include employees of service providers who perform tasks on the premises of the institution for a longer period of time.

** Integration of security aspects in all business processes **

The management must have an overview of the business-critical information, specialized tasks and business processes. The responsible technical officers and the information security management team must establish concrete rules for dealing with the relevant security aspects for all business processes (eg protective measures, classification and labeling of information).

** Rights and permissions **

To protect values, access to premises, access to IT systems and applications, and access to information must be regulated. Further information can be found in the module ORP.4 Identity and Authorization Management.

** Change Management **

Change management deals with the planning of changes to hardware and software as well as processes. Organizational requirements must ensure that aspects of information security are taken into account. More details can be found z. Eg in module OPS.1.2.1 Change Management.

** Configuration management **

Configuration management includes all the measures and structures that are required to monitor the state of the objects under consideration, starting with identification, through inventory management and updating to decommissioning.

Objects viewed (configuration elements) can be entire infrastructure areas, specific applications and IT systems, but also individual components thereof (for example, documentation).
As part of configuration management, processes and regulations must be introduced that describe how to manage information about the properties of the configuration items used, as well as information about security-related issues, issues, and changes related to configuration items. Typical activities include, for example, updating the list of IT systems or adapting security-relevant documentation to changes in business processes or applications. Recommendations for configuration management can be found in module OPS1.1.1 Proper IT Administration.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures correspond to the state of the art in the area of ​​"safety management".

#### ISMS.1.M10 Creation of a security concept

An information security concept serves to implement the security strategy and describes the planned procedure in order to achieve the set security objectives of an institution. The security concept is the central document in the security process of a company or public authority. Every concrete measure must ultimately be reduced to this. For this reason, a security concept must be carefully planned and implemented and regularly reviewed. The individual aspects briefly described below are dealt with in detail in the BSI Standard 200-2 IT Baseline Protection Procedure.

Not all areas of an institution need to be covered by a single security concept. If the implementation of the IT-Grundschutz in a big step represents a confusing task, it may make sense to first establish the required level of security in selected areas. From this base, the security process should then extend to the whole organization. Especially with large authorities and companies, there can be several security concepts that cover different organizational areas. But then it must be ensured that all areas of an institution are covered by appropriate security concepts.

Complex business processes or applications can be treated in their own security concepts. This is especially useful when introducing new tasks or applications.

The defined scope is referred to below as the information network and represents in detail the area for which the security concept is to be implemented. An information network can thus refer to specialist tasks, business processes or organizational units. It includes all infrastructural, organizational, personnel and technical components that serve the task in this application area of ​​information processing.

The information network must be defined so that the considered business processes and information can be completely assigned to this area. The dependencies of all safety-relevant processes must be taken into account. The interfaces to the other areas must be clearly defined, so that the information network in the entire company has a reasonable minimum size.

Security management must select a risk assessment methodology that allows for the analysis and assessment of potential incidental damage. It is also possible to select several consecutive methods for risk assessment.

The procedure for IT-Grundschutz implicitly carries out a risk assessment for areas with normal protection requirements.

However, in certain cases, for example if the considered information network contains components with high or very high protection requirements, an explicit risk analysis must be carried out. The necessary work steps are explained in BSI standards 200-2 and 200-3.
The basis of every risk assessment is the description of the information and business processes to be protected. In order to get an overview of the organizational or technical structures that are important for the business processes, the information network has to be structured. In addition to the technical components, the applications and the processing information, the spatial infrastructure and networking should also be included. At the same time, the dependencies of the various components must be recorded.

The protection needs assessment includes the following steps:

* It analyzes which threats or risks exist for the institution as a result of inadequate information security.
* Potential damage due to loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability is identified.
* The potential impact on business or task performance from security incidents and other security risks is analyzed and assessed.
These considerations can be used to estimate the risk for the company or the authority and to determine the protection requirements for information, applications and IT systems.

From the general safety objectives, the identified protection requirements and the risk assessment, concrete safety measures are derived according to the considered information network (see ISMS.1.M7 Definition of Safety Measures). Security process and security concept must take into account the individual rules and regulations. In order to derive concrete security measures, concrete building blocks of the IT-Grundschutz catalogs for the security requirements of an information network have to be selected in order to receive a specific package of security measures as target specifications.

In order to determine which of the security measures have already been implemented and where there are still gaps, a basic security check is carried out.

The implementation of the measures proposed by IT-Grundschutz is usually sufficient for typical business processes, applications and components with normal protection needs. However, a risk analysis is required for elements of the information network that

* have a high or very high protection requirement in at least one of the three basic values ​​of confidentiality, integrity or availability or
* can not be adequately mapped (modeled) with the existing building blocks of the IT-Grundschutz catalogs or
* are operated in application scenarios (eg in environments or with applications) that are not provided for in IT-Grundschutz.
On the basis of the risk situation, supplements or corrections to the security concept are made as part of the risk analysis. Risks for which no suitable or economic countermeasures can be taken are identified and also subjected to a systematic risk treatment.

Before the completion of a security concept, the additional measures identified in the risk analysis must be consolidated with the IT-Grundschutz measures. For all newly identified security measures, it must be checked whether they replace, supplement or impair the effectiveness of the existing measures. Subsequently, the results of the basic safety check must be completed and updated.

A security concept is only effective if the measures provided for in it are also put into practice promptly. This must be planned and controlled.
For this, it must be noted in which period of time the individual measures are to be implemented and which can be combined and implemented in a suitable combination. In addition, measures must be prioritized according to the urgency of implementation. The implementation planning should be recorded either in the security concept or in an attached implementation plan. This should include implementation order and responsibilities:

* Priority setting (implementation order): All security measures should be prioritized according to importance and effectiveness. In principle, measures against particularly serious hazards should be given priority. This is especially important when there is little protection against these hazards. Can z. If, for financial reasons, not all measures are implemented immediately, the measures with the greatest impact should be implemented first.
* The order of implementation should take into account possible interdependencies between measures.
* Responsibilities: For each action, it is necessary to determine who is responsible for their initialization, implementation and control (eg audit) or revision.
When selecting security measures, their suitability and cost-effectiveness must also be taken into account. It must be understandable why the selected measures are likely to meet the safety objectives and requirements. The documentation should therefore contain specific information on responsibilities and responsibilities as well as planned activities for inspection, audit, monitoring.

The order for the implementation of open activities is to be noted. In addition, the planned or deployed resources for the implementation of the individual security measures must be documented.

Since information security is a continuous process, it is not enough to implement the security measures once. Information security must be continuously improved. The security process therefore needs to respond to new technical developments. Vulnerabilities and new security vulnerabilities need to be considered. The security process should therefore be regularly reviewed, updated and any changes documented. Important procedures include the introduction of regular reports (see ISMS.1.A12 Information Security Management Reports) and reporting processes.

A certification of the security process documents compliance with a defined procedure and can be integrated into the security process as an independent review process.

The security concept is often used in practice to check specific security measures regarding their implementation or their timeliness. Therefore, it should be structured so that

* specific areas can be found quickly, and
* It can be updated with minimal effort (this can be done using a tool).
In addition, the individual security measures should be described in sufficient detail so that a third party can assume security-related tasks in the case of substitution.

A security concept may include confidential information, such as: For example, information on weaknesses that have not yet been eliminated or information on measures that help prevent or overcome these measures. Such confidential information may only be disclosed to the appropriate persons. The security concept should therefore be structured in such a way that the areas that affect a broad group of addressees are separated from those that can only be passed on to a limited extent. Each employee should at least be informed about the parts of the security concept directly related to him.
It is important to build a common understanding of information security in an institution. This includes the use of consistent and clear terms. Therefore, a glossary with the most important terms about information security should be prepared early. This glossary helps to create all security related documents. It can be published in the security concept or individually.

#### ISMS.1.M11 maintaining information security

The security process is not just about achieving the desired level of security, but also ensuring it permanently. In order to maintain and continuously improve the existing level of security, all security measures should be regularly reviewed.

Both the correct implementation and the feasibility of a security concept must be checked regularly. A distinction must be made between the examination of whether specific measures are appropriate and efficient in order to achieve the security objectives set (completeness check or update check) and the extent to which security measures have been implemented in the individual areas (revision of information security).

The security measures planned in the security concept must be implemented in accordance with the implementation plan. The implementation status must be documented. Target dates and resources must be monitored and controlled. The management level is to be informed regularly.

These reviews should be conducted at set times (at least annually) and may be done in between. In particular, findings from security-relevant incidents, changes in the technical or technical-organizational environment as well as changes in security requirements or threats require an adaptation of the existing security measures. The results obtained in the individual reviews should be documented. It also needs to know what to do with the verification results, as information security can only be effectively maintained if the necessary corrective action is taken based on the verification results.

Occasionally, unannounced checks should also be carried out as announced checks often give a distorted picture of the subject of the investigation.

Controls should above all be geared to remedying deficiencies. For the acceptance, it is important that this is recognizable to all participants as the aim of the controls and that the controls do not have the character of Schulmeisterei. It therefore makes sense to speak with the parties about possible solutions to problems during an inspection and to prepare appropriate remedies.

It should be decided in the authority or company how to coordinate the activities related to these reviews. It is necessary to regulate which security measures are to be checked when and by whom, so that duplication of work is avoided and no areas within an institution remain unchecked.

Existing security measures should be reviewed at least once a year. In addition, they are always to consider when

* new business processes, applications or IT components are built,
* major changes to the infrastructure are made (eg relocation),
* major organizational changes are pending (eg outsourcing),
* the risk situation changes significantly,
* when serious weaknesses or damage cases become known.
** Compliance with the security concept (security audit) **
In this case, it must be checked whether safety measures are actually implemented and adhered to as specified in the safety concept. It should also be examined whether technical measures have been correctly implemented and configured and whether all intended detection measures (eg evaluation of log files) are actually carried out.

This may show that security measures have not been implemented or that they do not work in practice. In both cases, the causes of the deviations should be determined. Possible corrective measures are - depending on the cause - in question:

* Organizational measures should be adapted
* Personnel measures, eg. B. Training and awareness-raising measures to be taken or disciplinary action initiated;
* Infrastructural measures, eg. B. structural changes, are to initiate,
* technical measures, eg. Changes to hardware and software or communication links and networks,
* Decisions of the responsible superior (up to the management level) are to be obtained.
In any case, a corrective action should be proposed for each deviation. It should also specify the timing and responsibilities for the implementation of the corrective action.

Controls should help to eliminate sources of error. It is extremely important for the acceptance of controls that no persons are exposed or identified as "guilty". If employees are afraid of this, they run the risk of not publicly reporting known vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities, but trying to cover up existing issues.

In advance, however, the reactions to breaches of the security requirements should be determined. Appropriate measures must be taken to help ensure that security incidents do not recur. This could include, for example, the restriction of access rights.

If inadmissible activities are detected by employees, the respective supervisor should be informed so that appropriate consequences can be triggered.

** Continuous improvement of the security concept (completeness or update check) **

The security concept must be regularly updated, improved and adapted to new conditions. It must be checked regularly whether the selected security measures are still suitable for achieving the security objectives. In the process, it can be directly examined whether the security measures used are efficient or whether the security objectives could be achieved with other measures in a more resource-efficient manner.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate external sources of knowledge, such as standards or professional publications, with a view to new technical and regulatory developments. Contacts with committees and stakeholders dealing with security issues also help the IS management team to expand and update their existing knowledge of security-related methods and solutions. In addition, valuable contacts are made with other information security officers in order to get to know solutions from other institutions and to exchange practical experience. This also creates ways to exchange early warnings about emerging security issues. The IS management team should have an overview of thematically appropriate committees and interest groups and determine where active participation is offered and where only the results should be regularly monitored and evaluated.

** Conduct of the exams **

Depending on the purpose of the examination, the scope and depth of the reviews must be specified. The security concept and the existing documentation of the security process serve as the basis for all checks.
A review should be carried out by persons with appropriate qualifications. However, these individuals should not have been involved in creating the concepts to avoid operational blindness and conflicts. The examiners or auditors must be as independent and neutral as possible.

Every check has to be planned carefully. All relevant findings and findings are to be recorded in a report. This should contain not only an evaluation but also correction suggestions. The report should be submitted to the head of the reviewed area and to the IS management team, who will need to design the next steps on this basis. Serious issues should be communicated directly to senior management, so that far-reaching decisions can be made promptly.

If special audit or diagnostic tools are used during the audit, as with the result documentation, it must be ensured that only authorized persons have access to it. Diagnostic and test tools as well as the test results must therefore be specially protected.

When outsiders are involved in auditing, it is important to ensure that no information is misused by the institution (eg through appropriate confidentiality agreements) and that they can only access the information they need (eg through access rights or four-eye control ). If you use testing tools, their use must be precisely regulated.

**Corrective actions**

Detected errors and weaknesses must be stopped promptly. The identified optimization needs for efficiency and effectiveness of security measures must be implemented.

Based on the results of the review, decisions about how to proceed should be made. In particular, all necessary corrective measures must be recorded in an implementation plan. The responsible persons for the implementation of the corrective measures are to be named and equipped with the necessary resources.

#### ISMS.1.M12 Information Security Management Reports [Institutional Management]

One of the tasks of the Information Security Officer is to assist the authorities or corporate management in fulfilling their overall responsibility for information security. An important basis for the decisions to be made is clear and meaningful information on the current state of information security in the institution.

In order to manage, maintain and continuously improve the safety process, its effectiveness and efficiency needs to be reviewed on a regular basis and these results assessed at the management level. The aim here is to coordinate the further procedure in the security process with the management level. Therefore, any necessary changes to the security process, such as the security objectives or the security policy, should be identified. The results must be documented and the previous records maintained.

** Regular Management Reports **

In order for the company or authority management to make the right decisions in controlling and directing the information security process, it needs to know key points about the state of information security. These key points should be prepared in management reports covering, inter alia:

* Results of audits and data protection checks
* Security incident reports
* Reports on past successes and information security process issues
Management should be kept regularly informed by the IS management team of the outcome of the reviews and the status of the IS process. Here, problems, achievements and opportunities for improvement should be pointed out.
A management report should be short and concise. The following points may be relevant depending on the current situation. However, not all should be considered simultaneously in an information security management report so as not to overload it. It is therefore worth thinking about

* to what extent the requirements of the security concept are already covered in the company or in the authority,
* where there are still gaps - and thus residual risks -
* which security incidents have occurred, which damages have occurred and which damages could be prevented,
* which results have provided internal reviews and audits
* To what extent the security level meets the security requirements and the threat situation of the institution,
* whether framework conditions have changed so further action is needed
* whether the information security activities were successful,
* whether the security measures have proven to be adequate to achieve the security objectives or whether measures need to be amended or supplemented,
* what feedback there was from customers, business partners, employees or the public on safety issues,
* which resources have been spent on information security
* whether and how the previous management decisions have been implemented and whether information security activities have been successful.
It should also provide an outlook on the likely evolution of information security across the organization, as well as on technical developments and practices that could potentially help to improve the security process.

** Event-related management reports **

In addition to the regular management reports, it may be necessary to create event-related management reports in the event of unexpected security issues or risks resulting from new technical developments. This is especially the case when these problems can not be solved at work level, because, for. B. Material resources outside the approved framework needed or more extensive staffing arrangements must be made.

Again and again, security incidents such as global malware attacks attract the attention of the mass media. In these cases, it has proven useful to create management reports to show how your own institution has been affected by these security incidents. Even as the security situation changes (eg, new threats, new technologies, new laws), an on-demand management report can be useful.

When drafting the management reports, it should be borne in mind that the readers are generally not composed of technical experts. Accordingly, the text should be characterized by the greatest possible clarity and scarcity, by specifically identifying the key points, such as existing vulnerabilities, but also achieved successes.

At the end of each management report, especially in case-related reports, there should always be clearly prioritized policy proposals with realistic estimates of the expected implementation effort. This ensures that a necessary management decision can be made without unnecessary delays.

The information security management report should be personally presented to senior management by a member of the IS management team. Thus, key priorities such as existing or imminent safety deficiencies can be emphasized. The member of the IS management team is also directly available for queries and further explanations, which experience has shown has accelerated the decision-making process.
In addition, personal contact is also important to better prepare for leadership decisions and mitigate problems in advance. It would also be helpful if a member of the management level with the appropriate professional background and interest is available as a contact person. Personal contact offers the opportunity to establish a "small service route", the existence of which can prove advantageous in emergencies.

** management decisions **

On the basis of the management report, the management decides on the further procedure in the security process. If necessary, the public agency or company management is supported by the information security officer. All decisions must be documented. These include in particular the following points:

* Required actions to improve the effectiveness of the security policy and the resources needed
* Amount of protection needs and treatment of residual risks identified during a risk analysis
* Changes to security-related processes to counter internal or external events that could affect the security concept, such as: B. in terms of changes in
* Business goals
* Security requirements
* Business processes
* external conditions (such as the legal environment or contractual obligations)
To continuously monitor the security process, all management reports and information security management decisions should be archived in an orderly fashion. If necessary, this documentation should be available to those responsible at short notice (see ISMS.1.M11 documentation of the safety process).

Since the information security management reports generally contain sensitive information about existing vulnerabilities and residual risks, their confidentiality needs to be protected. Appropriate safeguards must be put in place to prevent unauthorized persons from learning about the content of the management reports.

#### ISMS.1.M13 Documentation of the security process

The process of the security process, important decisions and the work results of the individual phases should be documented. Such documentation is an essential basis for the maintenance of information security and thus a crucial prerequisite for the efficient further development of the process. It helps to find and eliminate the causes of malfunctions and misguided processes. It is important that not only the current version is available at short notice, but also a central archiving of the previous versions is made. Only through the continuous documentation, the developments and decisions in the field of information security can be tracked traceable.

In addition to documents for security management and the security process, there are other documents relevant to security management. Depending on the object and intended use, the following types of documentation must be considered:

** Management reports **

For the top management of a public agency or a company to make the right decisions to ensure information security at a reasonable level, it needs the information it needs. To do this, the information security officer or IS management team should regularly and on an occasion-by-case basis generate information security management reports (see also ISMS.1.M10 Information Security Management Reports).

** Security process documents **

The following types of security process documentation should be created:
* Top management must define and publish the information security policy of the agency or company. Among other things, this contains the security objectives and the security strategy.
* The security concept describes the required security measures and defines their implementation.
* Based on the security guideline, there are area and system-specific security guidelines and regulations for the proper and secure use of IT.
* The essential work of the IS management team should also be documented. Eg minutes of meetings and decisions.
* Results of audits and reviews (eg checklists and survey logs).
** Documentation of work processes **

Workflows, organizational requirements and technical security measures must be documented in such a way that security incidents caused by ignorance or malpractice are avoided.

In the case of faults or security incidents, it must be possible to restore the desired target status of the business processes and IT. Technical details and workflows should therefore be documented in a way that is reasonably possible.

** Documentation of security incidents **

Security-related incidents must be prepared in such a way that all associated processes and decisions are traceable. Likewise, it should allow the documentation to make improvements to the emergency strategies and to avoid known errors. In addition, technical documents such as logs or system messages of particular relevance for the incident must be stored and archived to process security incidents. The rules of data protection must be complied with.

**Technical Documentation**

This type of security-related documentation includes:

* Installation and configuration instructions,
* Instructions for restart after a security incident,
* Documentation of test and release procedures and
* Instructions for the behavior in case of faults and security incidents.
** Instructions for employees **

Safety measures must be documented comprehensibly for the employees. So the employees have to

* applicable security policies,
* clear leaflets for the responsible handling of internal information, for the secure use of IT systems and applications as well as for the behavior during security incidents,
* Manuals and instructions for the IT systems and applications used
be available.

In rare cases, it may be sensible and necessary to violate a security policy. However, such a violation must be approved in advance by an authorized body. Exemptions may only be granted after thorough examination and in the rarest cases. Subsequently, a written justification must be written, which must be signed by the responsible person.

** Information flow and reporting channels **

Important for the maintenance of the security process is the description and timely updating of the reporting channels and the procedure for the flow of information.

** ** Dokumentationswesen

It is the task of the information security officer or the IS management team to provide always up-to-date and meaningful information security documentation. For all documentation in the context of the security process, there should therefore be a regular procedure. These include z. For example, the following points:

* Documentation must be understandable. This also means that they have to be tailored to the target group. Reports to the management level have different requirements than technical documentation for administrators.
* Documentation must be up to date. It must be determined who cares for them. They must be labeled and filed so that they can be found quickly if necessary. There must be information about creation date, version, sources and authors. Outdated documents must be immediately taken out of circulation and archived.
* There should be a defined procedure for introducing, assessing and, if necessary, taking account of proposed changes (including the preparation of new documents).
* In addition to the rapid transfer of information to authorized persons, on the other hand, the confidentiality of internal organizational details must be ensured. Confidential contents must be classified as such and the documents must be securely stored and processed.
When managing a multitude of security-relevant documents, document management can be helpful.

Documentation does not always have to be in paper form. The documentation medium can be selected as needed. The documentation may include overview diagrams (eg, network map), short session logs (eg, annual management meeting to discuss the security strategy), handwritten notes, or software tools (eg, to document the security plan).

#### ISMS.1.M14 Information security awareness

Another task that must accompany the entire security process is the organization and implementation of training and awareness-raising activities. The company or authority should develop a training and awareness-raising approach. A detailed discussion of this topic can be found in the ORP.3 Information Security and Information Security module.

#### ISMS.1.M15 Economical Use of Information Security Resources

The security goals set can only be achieved if adequate resources are provided for this purpose.

** Provision of information security resources **

Information security requires sufficient financial and human resources as well as appropriate equipment. These must be provided to the information security management team by the authorities or management to an appropriate extent.

It is recommended that the IS management team identify the resources needed to implement all identified actions based on the security objectives. On the one hand, this serves as the basis for management decisions on the allocation of resources and, on the other hand, for the definition of project plans and implementation periods.

** Access to external resources **

The internal security experts are often so busy with their routine activities that they can not analyze all security-relevant influencing factors or implement security solutions for new tasks or developments. These include, for example, changed legal requirements, the introduction of new IT systems and the tracking of current technical developments. In order to cope with peak workloads, additional internal staff must be employed internally or external experts must be recruited. The need must be communicated by the internal security experts to provide the senior management with the required resources.

It must be ensured that all required security measures are implemented, be it by recourse to external or internal forces.

** Resources for the Information Security Officer **
Without a well-functioning organizational structure for information security, the most expensive technical solutions will not help. Experience shows that the appointment of an information security officer is the most effective security measure. After appointing a security officer, the number of security incidents in most institutions decreases significantly. In order for the Information Security Officer to achieve a real level of security enhancement, he must

* have enough time for his work,
* Be sufficiently integrated into all business processes, specialist tasks and projects,
* have sufficient access to all required resources.
In smaller institutions, it is possible for an employee to perform the tasks of the information security officer in personal union in addition to his actual activities.

** Resources for the Information Security Management Team **

An IS management team should always be set up when the information security officer alone can no longer manage all business processes and projects, ie the institution has exceeded a certain size.

The initial establishment of the security process is usually associated with increased effort. Often it is therefore appropriate to provide the IS management team with additional human resources for this phase.

** Provide resources for IT operations **

The basic requirement for a secure IT operation is that it runs smoothly and is therefore reasonably planned and organized. Sufficient resources must be made available for IT operations. Typical problems of IT operations (tight budget, overburdened administrators, and an unstructured or poorly maintained IT environment) typically need to be addressed in order for the actual security measures to be effectively and efficiently implemented. Whether the resources provided are sufficient, for example, shows whether the users are adequately looked after or whether all hardware and software are tested as intended.

** Economic Aspects in the Security Strategy **

The security strategy should also consider economic aspects from the beginning. When selecting the security measures to be implemented, the available resources should be taken into account. If there is insufficient technical or human resources support for certain actions, the strategy needs to be changed. In many cases, other measures can be found that lead to a similar level of safety. But if the formulated security goals and the existing financial, technical or personnel options are too far apart, both the security objectives and the business processes must be fundamentally reconsidered. In this case, the management level must also be informed about this discrepancy, so that it can initiate corrective action if necessary.

When establishing security measures, the human and financial resources needed for implementation should always be specified. This includes the naming of persons responsible and other contact persons, as well as the definition of precise schedules and the materials to be procured. It is also advisable to document for all planned security measures whether the resources planned for information security were provided on time and what the reasons for project deviations were. This is the only way to achieve sustainable improvements and avoid disruptions.

** Information Security Checking Resources **
All safety measures must be checked regularly for their effectiveness and suitability. Again, adequate resources must be provided. In general, those who have designed safety measures should not test their effectiveness and suitability. For this purpose, external expertise can also be used to avoid operational blindness.

The question of whether sufficient resources are available for information security is much more difficult to answer than the review of purely technical aspects.

### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ISMS.1.M16 Creation of Targeted Security Policies (CIA)

** Target group oriented mediation of security topics **

An important factor for success in achieving an appropriate level of safety are responsible and competent employees who work together in a coordinated manner. In doing so, management, IT users, administrators and security experts bring very individual professional qualifications and perform various tasks. While company or government leadership has overall responsibility, sets goals, and defines framework conditions, administrators need to be technically highly skilled and have detailed knowledge to operate and securely configure IT systems.

Security officers are in a position to create a holistic security concept with the IT Grundschutz catalogs. This will often include many pages if it covers all areas of information security. An additional target group-oriented preparation and mediation of the contents of the security concept is an important task of the security management. The goal is for all employees to know and respect the safety aspects that affect them and their work area.

It is therefore advisable to create different security guidelines or detailed sub-concepts that represent individual security issues as needed. This gives employees exactly the information they need on a particular topic.

Separate security policies for IT systems or services that are in a security-critical area whose configuration is complex or whose application is complex may include technical instructions for administrators that are not generally understandable. Employees' documents, on the other hand, should be adequately prepared for security issues rather than having unnecessary details.

** Hierarchical structure of policies **

When formulating policies, it has worked well to work at different levels.

First, the first level should briefly and concisely formulate the general security objectives and the security strategy in an information security guideline (see ISMS.1.M3, Guidance on Information Security). The strategy contains no technical details and is approved by the management. At the next level, basic technical safety requirements should be derived.

The general security concept includes documents that describe various aspects of information security (eg a policy on internet usage or an anti-virus concept), without going into concrete products.
The third level describes technical details, concrete measures and product-specific settings. It contains many documents that are regularly changed and typically only read by the appropriate experts.

The following figure shows the structure described here graphically.

** Content of special security policies **

For example, the following topics are suitable for target group-specific processing in special security guidelines:

* Code of Conduct and Safety Information for IT Users
* Behavioral rules and security information for administrators
* Security gateways
* Virus protection, malware
* Emergency preparedness
* Data backup
* Archiving
* Secure use of e-mail and groupware
* Outsourcing, external service providers
** Security Policy for IT Use **

It is often advisable to specify the general objectives of the information security guideline in a security policy for IT use and to summarize the most important organization-wide measures of the security concept in a generally understandable manner, without technical details. This guideline describes the principles of organization-wide IT usage and guides employees through the security concept.

The following topics could be addressed in a general IT security policy:

* Dealing with sensitive information (definition of information owners, obligation to classify information according to need of protection)
* relevant laws and regulations
* Brief description of important roles (eg information security officer, administrator, user)
* Training of the staff
* Duty to set up representation arrangements
* Requirements for the administration of IT (procurement, use, maintenance, revision and disposal)
* basic security measures (access to premises and access to IT systems, encryption, virus protection, data backup, emergency preparedness)
* Regulations for specific IT services (data transfer, internet usage, cloud usage)
The BSI provides various sample guidelines and concepts on its websites in the area of ​​IT-Grundschutz as examples.

#### ISMS.1.M17 Completing Insurance (A)

Each institution must decide how to deal with the residual risks that remain after implementation of security measures. By taking out insurance, the financial damage can be reduced. Consequential damage resulting from the failure of the affected business processes can also be partially insured by appropriate insurance policies (eg insurance against business interruption caused by fire). It should be noted, however, that there may also be uninsurable residual risks. This concerns, for example, image damage. When taking out insurance, therefore, the specific conditions and any exclusion clauses should be taken into account. It should also be noted that a longer period of time may need to be bridged financially until the insurance company replaces the damage.

The types of insurance can be divided into:

* Third party damage (liability insurance)
* Personal injury, property damage including environmental damage as well as financial loss
* Property damage (property insurance, including software damage)
* Building insurance
* Property insurance
* Loss of earnings insurance (insurance against business interruption)
* Electronics insurance
* Fidelity insurance (eg insurance against computer abuse)
* Cyber ​​insurance
* Legal expenses insurance
The IT Baseline Protection tools provide a brief overview of which insurance companies can help in which areas to reduce the financial impact of potential damage.
