### 1.1 Introduction

It is only possible to successfully and efficiently realize information security within an institution if all employees recognize and accept that it is a significant and necessary factor for the success of the institution and if they are willing to effectively support security measures. For this, a safety culture and a safety awareness (awareness) must be built and maintained. Employees must be made aware of relevant hazards and how they can affect their institution, because the more they know about it, the sooner they will accept appropriate security measures. They also need to have the necessary skills to understand and apply actions properly. In particular, they must be aware of what is expected of them in terms of information security and how they should respond in safety-critical situations.

Awareness and training are equally required to provide employees with the necessary knowledge. The goal of information security awareness is to raise employee awareness of safety-critical situations and their impact. Through information security training, employees should acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for safety-conscious behavior, for the private and professional environment.

Adequate information security should be internalized by all employees as a natural part of their work environment. This requires a long-term change in behavior in many areas, especially if information security is associated with a loss of comfort or functionality. Achieving sustainable results requires a continuous process. Therefore, the institution needs to develop and establish an end-to-end information security awareness and training program. It should begin by hiring staff, consider different audiences with their skills, work processes, and resources needed, as well as assisting employees as their roles or positions change.

### 1.2 Life cycle

A sensitization and training program must be tailored to the institution and take into account the culture that exists there (see also 3.1.1 Consideration of safety-related personal factors in the further information) as well as the necessary level of safety. In this context, the most diverse and coordinated methods and media should be used.

** planning and conception **

It is very important for the security process that it is actively supported by the management. To do this, management must have recognized and internalized the value of information security for the institution's goals (see ORP.3.M1 Awareness-raising of Information Security Management).

This support can begin with the explicit mandate to design appropriate programs. The necessary steps are described in measure ORP.3.M4 Concept of a training and awareness-raising program for information security. In particular, it is important to define the target groups (see ORP.3.M5 Analysis of target groups for awareness-raising and training programs).

**Procurement**

Internal and / or external staff is needed to prepare and conduct awareness raising and training activities (see 3.1.2 Selection of Trainers or External Training Providers in the Further Information).

**Implementation**
In the implementation phase, employees are assigned to the previously defined target groups and target group-specific content is selected for awareness-raising and training measures (see ORP.3.M6 Planning and Conducting Sensitizations and Information Security Training). The subject matter should be suitably taught, for example by means of simulation games (see 3.1.3 Implementation of Information Security Planning Games). Measures must also be implemented which make the contact persons responsible for safety issues known to the employees (see ORP.3.M2 contact for safety issues).

** Operation, continuous care and development **

Another important component of information security training is the handling of information technology. Especially when new techniques are introduced, employees should be informed about them at an early stage and made aware of potential dangers and safety measures.

In order to improve the presence of imparted teaching content, teaching methods can be used (see 3.1.4 Safeguarding Syllabus). It should also be checked regularly whether the awareness-raising and training measures are successful (see ORP.3.M8 Measurement and Evaluation of Learning Outcomes). If necessary, these must be adapted.

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the area of ​​awareness and training.

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:

#### ORP.3.M1 Sensitization of Information Security Management [Supervisors, Institutional Management]

Strong and active government / management support is essential to ensure safety campaigns for employees. It is therefore necessary to raise awareness of safety issues before staff information awareness campaigns begin.

The most important information that must be provided to management is:

* ** Presentation of security risks and associated costs **
 The attention of the decision makers can z. This can be achieved, for example, by reports of security incidents that could affect your own institution as well. Examples of concrete neighborhood security incidents or similar institutions can increase the level of management backing. Such examples can be found in journals, in daily newspapers (eg, after hacker attacks or virus incidents), and in some detail on the Internet. Actual claims in the past from your own institution can also be used for this purpose. The specific hazards from relevant IT-Grundschutz modules can also serve as a basis here. The representation of financial damages in concrete numbers is difficult. Statistics and evaluations, such as those occasionally published by the police or security journals, may provide appropriate information in some cases.
* ** impact on business processes **
 It is important to understand the potential impact of information security incidents on business-critical processes. Dependencies on applications and IT systems, as well as Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Internet of Things (IoT), and other components are not always well-known to management. However, a list of potential security risks is usually insufficient to support management win. Balanced reasoning should also include the following points.
* ** Legal Security Requirements **
Laws and other legal requirements may also impose information security requirements in an institution, including, for example, privacy laws, the Social Security Code, the Commercial Code, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, the IT Security Act, etc. Many legislative phrases regarding information security requirements are generalized and can be non-binding. Concrete analysis can be used to derive concrete obligations for ensuring an appropriate level of safety. An institution must examine which regulations and laws can be effective.
* ** Advantages of a certification **
 A certification of information security processes officially confirms the high regard for information security in an institution. The confidence of the business partners and the public in the institution is thereby strengthened. Certification brings competitive advantages to sales and marketing.
* ** Standard Information Security Practices for the Industry **
 An additional motivation for using information security standards is the behavior of other similar organizations. Information about industry standards can be obtained from industry journals, from events or through contacts with chambers and associations.
An appropriate way to raise management awareness is to write a short report (possibly live hacking) followed by a presentation that uses current examples (external and internal) to explain the subject of information security. For example, it should be pointed out that technical measures without simultaneous human and organizational measures are pointless. In order to get the support of the management, it is helpful to show the benefits of such measures.

Experience has shown that information security is only successfully implemented in an institution if all superiors lead by example. It makes sense, therefore, to explicitly oblige all executives to inform and sensitize their employees to compliance with the security requirements.

#### ORP.3.M2 Contact for security questions

In each institution there must be contact points for security issues, both for seemingly simple as well as for complex and technical issues. These can be IT administrators, IT application managers or the information security officer.

Often the inhibition threshold to report concrete security incidents is high. However, if the Information Security Officer is already known to staff as the point of contact for general information security issues, this may remove barriers to reporting specific security issues.

In addition, the institution must communicate to its employees that the reporting of security incidents does not adversely affect them and urge them to report any suspicion of a security incident promptly and, if necessary, anonymously.

Since many security issues arise in the private use of IT systems, information security officers should also forward to allegedly non-official matters information, such. For example, to phishing, to the problem of computer viruses and Trojan horses in Internet use or for the protection of personal data in e-commerce. This will make employees more open to security and more acceptable to the Information Security Officer. In addition, experience shows that many allegedly private problems also occur in the office.
All employees must be familiar with the contact persons for safety issues as well as the reporting channels for security incidents. The contact details of the registration office should be published efficiently on the intranet with names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. Flyers that remain permanently in the workplace support sustainability.

#### ORP.3.M3 Instructing the staff in the safe handling of IT [Supervisors, Human Resources, IT Operations]

Many security problems arise from incorrect use or configuration of the IT. To prevent such problems, all employees and external users must be trained and trained in the safe handling of the institution's IT, ICS, and IoT components, as far as their work contexts are concerned.

All users of IT, ICS and IoT components must be made aware of their rights and obligations in using them. For this, they must be provided with specific guidelines, which they must observe when dealing with the IT, ICS and IoT components. Such a guideline must describe the general conditions that exist when using the IT, ICS and IoT components under consideration and the security measures to be taken. It helps users to get clear and unambiguous information about what they should not do under any circumstances. These guidelines must be binding, understandable, current and available. In order to document the liability, it should be signed by the authorities, or at least by the persons responsible for their operation. It is also advisable to formulate it in a short and understandable manner so that it can be distributed, for example, as a poster, notepad, flyer or similar. In addition, they should be available on the intranet.

In principle, user guidelines should only contain rules that can also be implemented and are formulated as positively and comprehensibly as possible. For example, a user policy might take place

"* Users are not allowed to install any software on their own. *"

better read as follows:

"* All IT systems are delivered in a standard configuration that has been customized to your specific working conditions and provide you with maximum security.In case of problems we can guarantee a quick solution by reinstalling the default configuration, so do not change the settings! Hardware or software, please contact the user service. * "

Further examples of user guidelines can be found under the IT Baseline Protection Tools.

A user policy for general IT use should include at least the following:

* Note that no IT systems, IT or IoT components may be used without explicit permission
* Note that only those employees may change information on IT systems that are authorized to do so
* Introduction of external data into your own home (for example USB, download or mail attachment)
* Handling passwords
* Prohibition of use of unauthorized software
* Note that IT services may only be used for official purposes, or a precise description of possible exceptions to this rule, if any
* Information on safe storage and installation of IT systems and data media
* Protection against computer viruses and other malware
* Performing backups
* Use of Internet and e-mail services
In addition to such policies, it is important to have clear statements about which users may access which information, to whom it may be shared, and what action will be taken in the event of a breach of these guidelines.
When a user leaves work, they should make sure that every piece of equipment (documents, media, etc.) is kept safe. All IT systems should be protected by passwords against unauthorized access. For unattended IT systems, the computer must be locked at least.

The basic configuration of all IT systems should be as limited or as slim as possible. The default configuration of workstations should include only the services required by all users in a group. Further programs or functions may only be installed or activated if the users have been instructed in their handling and sensitized to any safety problems.

Each user code should be drawn up in cooperation with representatives of all groups involved, in particular staff representatives and data protection and information security officers should be involved in good time. When changing a user order, it must be ensured that those concerned are involved again in advance. The changed user regulations must be announced to all users.

The job description must include all tasks and obligations relevant to information security. This includes u. a. the commitment to in-house guidelines on information security.

If IT, ICS or IoT systems or services are used in ways that conflict with the interests of the agency or the company, anyone who learns about them must notify their supervisors.

Together with the basic measures, the following measures are in line with the state of the art in the field of awareness and training.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures are in line with the state of the art in the field of "awareness-raising and training".

#### ORP.3.M4 Designing an information security awareness and training program

Employees are the key success factors in establishing and maintaining information security in an institution. It is they who use or administer technical protection systems, which more or less carefully observe the guidelines and specifications, and who can make safety-relevant errors out of ignorance or intent. Therefore, a target group-oriented awareness-raising and training program should be developed and regularly reviewed and updated.

The technical and organizational measures implemented as part of a security concept affect the individual employees in a variety of ways. For example, they may be forced to make regular password changes, be denied access to certain areas of the institution without authorization, have their employee ID cards clearly visible, or attend regular security training.

The aim of any institution should therefore be that all employees recognize, accept and actively support the value and the need for adequate information security for the performance of their duties and the continued existence of the institution. They should respect the existing rules and measures and their behavior should help to maintain and develop information security. They should be able to recognize safety-critical situations as early as possible and to react to them correctly.
This requires a systematic sensitization of the employees, which is to be anchored in the institution through a continuous process. Building on awareness, employees should be provided with all the necessary information and skills through complementary training (see ORP.3.M3 Staff training in how to handle IT safely). Awareness and training programs are thus closely related topics that should be given high priority at all organizational levels. Management needs to support the measures so that the importance of awareness-raising measures can be recognized and the resources needed for planning, implementation and maintenance are available.

The following aspects are helpful in designing and building the awareness-raising and training program.

Information security awareness means sharpening the awareness of information security among employees and training their security awareness according to the institution's needs.

At the beginning of sensitization, a goal should be defined and further refined in the further course of this measure. This way, content can be developed precisely and the success of the measures can be measured later. Target definition should focus on why information security is important to the institution and its people.

Example of a target definition:

Audience analysis can be used to tailor awareness-raising to specific needs and backgrounds of staff (see ORP.3.M5 Analysis of target groups for awareness-raising and training programs). Audience analysis identifies employees with similar information security characteristics, such as: "Administrators", "Human Resources" or "External Employees". Furthermore, the developments of the employee career that are characteristic for the institution, eg. B. Department, function or relocation.

The awareness-raising measures are to be prepared for the target group. As a result, z. B. Impact of security incidents for the respective employees are described as practically as possible. It has also proven to be extremely effective to include examples of employees' privacy in awareness-raising programs, such as the loss of digital photos from the last vacation or a lost smartphone.

Awareness campaigns can include any topic that explains why information security is important to the institution and its employees. These include z. B. relevant hazards or exemplary as well as real security incidents at which proper behavior can be trained. Care should be taken to ensure that sufficient content has a close connection to the institution as well as its framework conditions and the targeted target group. In addition, examples from similar institutions or meaningful publications may underpin the content.

Select media and methods that are closely aligned with the prevailing culture of the institution. The goal is to reach employees with reasonable costs as impressively and sustainably as possible and to sensitize them for information security. That is, employees' perceptions, emotions, and abilities for vulnerabilities and incidents in their work environment need to be strengthened so they can identify, evaluate, and respond to them at an early stage. It should be waived on pure instruction texts, detailed and detailed written regulations and an incomprehensible terminology in favor of a short and concise communication (see also ORP.3.1.3 implementation of information security game).
Awareness and training are closely related topics that complement each other in their implementation and build on each other. Sensitization should motivate employees to act. The right behaviors are then further supported by training. In practice, it is a great challenge to interest information security professionals and to maintain the right behavior. The clearer, more enthusiastic and more impressive the overall concept of the measures is, the more effectively the material can be processed and applied to the employee. Therefore, the curriculum must be consolidated through appropriate measures (see ORP.3.1.4 Syllabus).

The success of the established awareness and training objectives must be measured and evaluated. For this purpose, the status of the participants should be recorded before, during and after the measure on the basis of suitable indicators or criteria. This helps to track whether the campaign is successful and how awareness is developing. Further information is shown in measure ORP.3.M8 Measurement and evaluation of the learning success.

Information security in an institution is subject to constant change. IT systems, processes, performance spectrums, competitive situations are changing and, as a result, vulnerabilities, risk assessments and required security measures. In addition, the results of the previous sensitization measures have to be considered, in particular necessary changes due to the measurement and evaluation of the learning success.

These changes need to be carefully analyzed and the awareness-raising and training program regularly updated.

#### ORP.3.M5 Analysis of target groups for awareness-raising and training programs

When an awareness-raising and training program is created for an institution, the concept should be used to define the respective target groups (see ORP.3.M4 Designing an Information Security Training and Awareness Program). For this purpose, a detailed target group analysis should be carried out, so that measures can be focused on special requirements and different backgrounds.

For example, employees with comparable professional backgrounds, knowledge or tasks can be grouped together to form a target group. A practicable approach is also to derive the target groups from the organizational units. As a rule, it can be assumed here that employees work with comparable technology and similar specifications.

Another criterion is events that occur within an employee's career. These include z. New hiring, task or department change, relocation, change of technology, changes in the existing organization or leaving the institution.

Examples of possible target groups and their characteristics:

** Management ** level

The members of the management level act as role models for the employees. Often they have little time, so awareness-raising and training needs to be structured and concise. The motivation of the information security management level can be achieved through appropriate personal target agreements.

**Employee**

The behavior of this target group in everyday work has the strongest direct impact on information security. It should be noted here that the level of knowledge and the general conditions within the target group can be very different. For example, software developers have different IT equipment and other responsibilities and skills than human resources personnel. It can also be assumed that the personal orientations of these two target groups are quite different. The two groups require different information security training content.

** ** Administrators
Administrators and support staff need in-depth knowledge of the IT systems and applications they manage, so they can identify and fix security issues and prevent them.

** Human resources department (anteroom, post office, press area) **

Employees in this department have a high need for information about data protection requirements. Furthermore, the personnel of the personnel department are essential drivers for the description of the areas of responsibility per employee, the comprehension of the representative regulation as well as the publication of central areas of responsibility of the colleagues within the institution.

** External project staff **

In many cases, external people who work closely with or even in the institution have access to internal information, applications, or systems.

This audience must also support and be committed to the institution's information security objectives and rules, as do internal staff. This requires appropriate training, such. In the form of briefings with documented information. These measures should be carried out by the external institution in accordance with the requirements agreed with its own institution.

** ** new hires

This target group has so far had no contact with the organization's information security. For this reason, the contents of information security must be effectively communicated within the framework of the initial information and employees must be obliged to do so. Procedures that incorporate this step into the welcome process have proven useful.

#### ORP.3.M6 Planning and Conducting Information Security Education and Training

An information security training program should provide employees with all the information and skills needed to implement the institution's security policies and measures.

Once the information security training objectives for the institution have been identified, as well as relevant target groups and their specific training needs have been identified (see ORP.3.M5 Analysis of Awareness and Training Awareness and Training Areas), the specific training modules and content must be planned and implemented accordingly by: Target groups are trained according to this plan.

The following aspects should be considered:

* In what depth and with which methodology should which target group be trained?
* Which employees belong to which target group?
* What resources are needed for a target audience, such as: Eg trainer capacity, premises, required IT infrastructure, organization etc.?
* Which specific work environments with their information security requirements and which associated measures must be taken into account, eg. B. Processes, procedures, tasks and roles including possible changes?
** Possible training content **

In the following, a structure and important contents of training modules are presented by way of example, which, according to the aspects presented, still have to be processed in terms of roles and resources. For many areas, training offers from appropriate providers are available if internal planning and implementation in the institution is not possible.

The modules initially differ only by topic. Each module can be carried out in an adapted content depth. This depends on which work environment or section of an employee's career the module is intended for.
The content of the training should be established on the basis of the analysis developed in action ORP.3.M4 Conception of an information security training and awareness-raising program and should be regularly reviewed and adjusted to maximize the effectiveness of the training. In addition, all components of the IT-Grundschutz Compendium that are relevant for the respective information network should be checked to see whether the necessary measures were not only arranged but also trained.

Also exemplary here the training modules were assigned to the target groups. It is indicated by "X" that the respective module for the appropriate role is recommended. An "O" indicates the optional training modules that should be decided on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the content is needed for the role in question.

Table: Suggested training modules per function

In this example, the two modules 1 and 2 serve as basic training for all employees and are to be coordinated closely with awareness-raising measures. All other modules show which areas of specialization should also be taught depending on the subject.

Depending on the type of institution, it may be useful to define other target groups and the associated training objectives (see ORP.3.M5 Analysis of the Target Groups for Awareness and Training Programs). It is also important to involve employees who have little or nothing to do with information technology in the first place, such as: B. the security and cleaning service.

** Module 1: Information Security Basics **

#### ORP.3.M7 Training on how to proceed according to IT-Grundschutz

Security officers need to know the IT-Grundschutz methodology very well in order to use it successfully. The procedure in the institution must be based on the current form of the standard and the orientation of the ISMS in the institution.

#### ORP.3.M8 Measurement and evaluation of learning success [Human Resources]

Information security learning outcomes should be measured and evaluated in relation to specific target groups in order to determine to what extent the objectives described in the awareness-raising and training programs have been achieved (see ORP.3.M4 Concept of an Information Security Training and Awareness Program). This makes it possible to obtain a detailed overall picture and to take selective corrective action if individual goals have not been achieved.

The HR department often has good experience in evaluating training. Therefore, it is advisable to follow this procedure and to coordinate with the human resources department.

To test learning success, both quantitative and qualitative aspects of awareness and training programs should be considered. The results should be used appropriately to improve the awareness and training offer.

The following options can be used for this:

** Documentation of awareness-raising or training **

The documentation of all measures including a brief description of the contents and the implementation cycles provide a first overview of the scope and affected target groups of the activities carried out.

** Documentation of Participants in Sensitization or Training **
The documentation of the number of participants of training courses or the number of employees reached by awareness-raising activities per department, area, location, etc. provide an indication of the achieved penetration of the measures in the institution.

** Number of inquiries to security contact persons ** (see ORP.3.M2 contact for security questions)

Increasing the number of contacts to security contacts following training or awareness raising may be seen as an indication of increased employee sensitivity, but also as a result of the increased visibility of the organization.

** ** Training Reviews

A first qualitative overview of the training achievements is provided by standardized training assessment sheets, which are usually completed by the participants at the end of an event. In addition to questions about the procedure, the organization of the event or the approach of the speaker, questions about the benefit assessment by the participants can be incorporated here.

** Completion Test **

Knowledge tests conducted during or after a training session are proven methods of learning success control. Adapted to the respective event content, questions about learned knowledge as well as questions about the assessment of described situations can form the basis.

** Knowledge test at a time interval **

In order to determine the course of learning curves after training sessions, further tests can be carried out after the end of a training at fixed times. Since there is no direct link to the event, it can be difficult to motivate the participants to answer knowledge questions. To counter this, this test can also be performed in quiz form, z. B. with prices for the participants. The procedure of proving a minimum of basic knowledge each year is also widespread. WBT (Web Based Training) modules are recommended for this, ie intranet-based training modules that employees can work on at a self-determined time.

** ** employee surveys

Employee interviews with standardized questionnaires can collect information on whether non-school awareness-raising measures are also effective.

** Number of rule violations **

Another way of assessing whether a measure has been successful is to count the number of rule violations before and after the awareness-raising measures. In addition, responsible persons can place consciously and controlled security gaps and observe how coworkers handle it. For example:

* Unauthorized persons traveling around the institution unaccompanied
* USB sticks that are located at different locations in the institution
* E-mails sent to employees with attachments or links to unknown websites but with familiar sender addresses
* Door lock functions blocked
It is important to interpret the results never as misconduct of individual employees, but as results of groups. Such an approach must also be carefully coordinated in the institution (for example, with the involvement of management and staff representatives).

** Social Penetration Testing / Social Engineering Audits **

To test a learning success in the context of social engineering prevention, social penetration tests or social engineering audits can be carried out. In the role of an external attacker, an attempt is made to exploit employee misconduct and obtain information that helps the tester reach the intended targets.
However, these types of audits are always controversial, as employees who were selected as targets without their knowledge could view the evaluation as a breach of trust or exposure after a successful attack. On the other hand, such audits provide good insights into how information security is really lived. Therefore, the use of this method should be examined on a case-by-case basis and weighed up with the staff representatives and the management.

**Practical exercise**

As an alternative to the social penetration tests described, practical exercises can also be used. Here, different variants are possible, which give an overview of the awareness and training level. Subsequent to training courses can be built, in which situations are playfully presented, for example, a social engineering attack. The task for volunteers from the group would be to respond to this attack. An anonymous evaluation of the exercise by the seminar instructor provides information about the learning success of previous measures.

** Tools and games **

Educational games or tools of any kind in most cases also provide the opportunity to evaluate game results or results developments.

### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirements

The following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ORP.3.M9 Specialized Training of Exposed Persons and Institutions (CIA)

If there are particularly exposed persons in the institution, such as functional or secret carriers, or if the institution or individual areas themselves are an attractive target (eg for possible IT attacks or industrial espionage), then in-depth training should be provided with regard to possible threats and appropriate behaviors and precautions are taken.

These include, for example, precise guidelines for dealing with sensitive information or behavioral training for specific situations.

If the institution is processing highly sensitive or classified information, consideration should also be given to providing specialized training. For example, the training program (see ORP.3.M6 Planning and Conducting Information Security Training) could be extended to include another security intelligence module.

** Module: ** Security

Employees involved in material and IT security related tasks should have basic knowledge and skills in performing substantive and IT security activities. The module dealing with information relevant to the protection of the workplace should include the following topics:

* Fundamentals of personal and material security
* Structure and content of the classified information instruction (VSA)
* current and in-depth presentation of
* organizational measures (eg security documentation)
* material-technical measures (eg technical guidelines, eavesdropping)
* IT-specific measures (eg IT security products and operating environments, approval / certification / approval, radiation safety)
* Application example for the processing of confidential information in the information network
3 Further information

### 3.1 Worth knowing

Depending on the industry, the technology used or other framework conditions, additional (user-defined) requirements may arise for an information network. These may include, for example, the following measures.
One of the most important pillars of information security in an institution is its staff. Even the most elaborate technical safety precautions are worthless without the proper behavior of the employees. An awareness of what information security means for the institution and its business processes, and the proper treatment of employees with the values ​​and information of the institution to protect are essential for this.

The security measures chosen for the institution should always be based on the employees. Their knowledge and handling of information and IT should be included. To assess how people behave from a safety perspective, the factors contributing to this behavior can be analyzed. Building on this, we can examine where personal and organizational security can be improved, for example through awareness-raising and information security training.

The following aspects should be considered:

** ** safety culture

The term safety culture encompasses the safety-related attitudes, values ​​and fundamental convictions of an institution and all its employees. The culture of safety also includes how open the handling of information security issues is lived in the institution. For example, a trustworthy and open communication culture is important for the effective and efficient handling of security incidents, so that security incidents can be immediately reported on and solution-oriented addressed.

* What is the dealings in the agency or the company with business-related information and risks in general? Is the institution more risk-oriented or risk-avoidant? Is information given more freely or restrictively?
* What are the requirements for accuracy and precision? Are minor errors tolerable in texts, for example, because they still have to go through several tuning processes anyway? Can an input error already lead to serious damage?
* What are the requirements for availability? Are there a lot of tight deadlines? Can processing times for inquiries and business processes be set flexibly? Are minor missed deadlines or changes generally acceptable or do they lead to harsh consequences?
The security culture of an institution is strongly influenced by the industry in which it operates. In high-security areas, information is naturally less openly handled than in research institutions.

** knowledge and ability **

* How well do employees know about IT? Is IT and Internet use more of a necessity to make business processes more effective, or is life and work unimaginable without IT and the Internet?
* What experience and knowledge do employees have regarding information security and data protection? How well trained are their skills in the field of IT-based security measures, such as Encryption? How is the knowledge distributed in the various areas of the institution?
* What is the way employees interact with information security and privacy issues? How do employees view the need to protect information from change or unauthorized disclosure?
* Can employees actively contribute their information security ideas and ideas to the security process?
** Security Policies **

* Do the security policies of the institution match the business processes and internal security culture? Are they easy to implement? Are they practical and adapted to the current environmental conditions? Do they interfere with work processes? Do they support desirable behaviors? Are you known to all?
** Applications and IT **
* Do the existing IT, ICS, and IoT components handle the business-relevant information that meets their protection needs and security requirements?
** managerial level **

* What is the management level regarding information security? Do superiors fulfill their role model function? Are there management wishes to improve security processes?
** Cultural Backgrounds **

* The cultural background can also influence the handling of information to be protected and security requirements in general. Therefore, it should be examined whether there are regional and national differences in information security management. Above all, it should also be explored what different approaches to information security exist in the different areas of the institution. Even individual departments or field offices can already develop their own rules and behaviors when dealing with business-related information.
** Changes **

* All kinds of far-reaching changes for employees can change their way of handling information, business processes, IT and other devices. These include, for example, restructuring, dismissals, changes of tasks or superiors.
If the analysis reveals that employees behave differently than it makes sense from a security point of view, there are several ways to deal with it. Attempts should be made to change the behavior of employees. On the other hand, in many cases it may be easier to redesign the security policies or workflows and make them more secure.

Those responsible for awareness-raising and training programs should clarify whether and to what extent they want to use their own staff or external providers as trainers. In addition, the form of training must be determined. If a program includes several awareness-raising and training activities, a training coordinator should be appointed. In addition, various offers from training providers should have been compared, which are the best in terms of content, quality and price. The awareness-raising or training activities carried out should be evaluated by the participants and regularly evaluated internally.

If one's own employees are to be used as trainers, they must have the necessary specialist knowledge and be able to convey this knowledge in a target group-oriented manner. In addition to the required information security knowledge, trainers must have strong didactic, methodological and communication skills. In particular, awareness-raising activities require sufficient knowledge of the institution, its safety culture and business processes. It is important that coaches master the language of their respective target audience, ie be able to put the information security aspects to be trained in the respective work and project contexts. Internal trainers must be given the time they need to not only carry out awareness-raising and training, but also prepare and evaluate it.

For cost or qualification reasons, it may be more advantageous, at least initially, to have the training carried out by external specialists. Already in the planning phase it has to be clarified which financial resources are available for it. The external trainers should be carefully selected based on content, quality and price criteria and prepared for their task. In particular, they must be provided with the necessary institutional background. Internal speakers can use these courses as an accompaniment to prepare for their own efforts.
External resources for awareness-raising or training also require internal resources. It should be named a responsible training coordinator who

* selects qualified training providers,
* Provides learning content and methods, as well as providing the trainers with the information they need
* coordinates internal training planning, preparation and implementation,
* forms the communication interface between trainers and own employees,
* Analyzes participant assessments and identifies appropriate improvement measures, if necessary together with the trainers.
The training coordination can be carried out by the information security officer, also an employee from the human resources department or a person from the ISMS team around the ISB. The Information Security Officer and the Human Resources Department must work closely together in any case.

Experience has shown that there are a number of external providers who offer appropriate awareness-raising or training in a form that meets the needs of the institution or that can be adapted with reasonable effort.

In awareness-raising or training activities that aim to reach more employees in several cycles, it is worthwhile thinking about a "train the trainer" concept. Here, the initial measures are carried out either by suitable internal staff or external trainers with the aim that the participants of these measures later take on a coaching role themselves. This can have a very positive effect on their own awareness and motivation for information security for these employees. In addition, they can contribute their own experiences to the training measures. Especially with training topics that include aspects of culture and certain behaviors within the institution, an internal trainer can increase the acceptance and learning of the training because of his deeper knowledge of internal processes and awareness of the participants. If the "train the trainer" concept is to be used, the initial measures must contain not only the intended subject matter but also instructions on methodical and didactic teaching.

The awareness-raising or training activities should be finalized by the participants. These experiences should be regularly evaluated internally.

Many safety trainings perceive participants as dry, which has a negative impact on the desired learning effect. A good way to relax the curriculum is plan or role play. Participants usually remember such games longer and more succinctly than classical slide presentations. They also help to make the threats clearer and to highlight typical weaknesses as well as possible solutions in one's own working environment. They enable the participants to practice situations in order to act more routinely in an emergency. It should be examined whether the remaining awareness and training content can be supported by the use of simulation games.

Simulation games can be made of practical examples, eg. For example, based on recent events from the media, or compiled themselves or commissioned from training service providers. The contents of the simulation games should be adapted to the own institution as far as possible. This allows employees to better identify with the solutions shown. By simulating z. For example, in security incidents that can interfere with business-critical processes, employees are well-prepared in the event of an emergency.

As with training courses, the target group content planning is very important in these formats. The participants should be able to recognize the relevance of role-playing games and be able to benefit directly in their work environment.
All efforts to make employees aware of the importance of information security should preserve a positive and constructive mood. Constant fear of security incidents can on the one hand lead to the suppression of security problems and on the other hand to panic reactions.

The following examples show that simulation games can range from very easy-to-implement training exercises to complex simulation exercises. The task of the responsible planners is now to develop suitable scenarios according to the requirements of the different target groups.

** Carrying employee IDs **

Short role-playing games allow employees to practice very well how to behave when they encounter people outside the organization within the institution. It can be practiced how the employees can optimally react to this situation, for example by offering to accompany the external parties to the interlocutor. Also, dealing with visitors who know the house rules, but refuse, can be trained, for example, if a visitor refuses to carry an ID card, because he is personally acquainted with the CEO.

** Social **

In simulations, employees can practice how to behave in social engineering attacks. For this purpose, the selected target groups such. For example, IT supervisors and various groups of administrators are faced with supposedly harmless requests in a joint simulation. Only through the interdisciplinary consideration of these requests it becomes clear that there is an attack here. The aim of the simulation is to find out these relationships through appropriate exercises in order to then be able to react in a defined manner. This type of simulation can be very well done in practice through workshops with moderation materials such as pin board and moderation cards.

** simulation exercises **

Particularly important are simulations in which the treatment of security incidents up to emergencies is practiced. They should enable employees to perceive assigned roles and responsibilities within a scenario even under difficult conditions (tension, accumulation of instructions, unclear or often changing circumstances, lack of resources, communication problems, etc.) as safely as possible. The goal of simulations is primarily to train personal abilities using representative scenarios that can then be used in as many incidents as possible. Therefore, a simulation should be led by an experienced trainer, who discusses and deepens their experiences in a review with the participants.

In the conception of awareness-raising and training programs, the provision of teaching aids is important, since only permanently present knowledge leads to the desired behavioral changes. After awareness-raising and training activities, participants are usually equipped with a lot of new knowledge and skills. If they do not retrieve or apply this knowledge after the event, they may forget it in whole or in part. In order to permanently improve the awareness of information security among employees, the content of awareness-raising and training should be regularly repeated or applied. This is supported by the Syllabus, which should be carried out both during the course, at the end of a course and thereafter.

The selection of measures to secure teaching material must be coordinated with the respective organizational culture and size.

Examples of measures for teaching material safety are:

* written or oral tests during the training and / or graduation
* Quiz questionnaires with learning opportunities on training content
* Intranet-based surveys on the content of the training courses
* Use of team meetings etc. to discuss current aspects of information security
* Implementation of planned or role-playing games (see ORP.3.M11 Implementation of Information Security Planning Games)
* regular repetition of seminars
* short notes on the intranet
* additional short lectures, eg Eg in the context of other internal events
