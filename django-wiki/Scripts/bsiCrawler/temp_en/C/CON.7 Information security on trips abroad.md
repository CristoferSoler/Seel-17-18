### 1.1 Introduction

The importance of travel necessities has steadily increased in recent years as a result of globalization and the resulting increase in international networking between public authorities and companies. In order to be able to work outside of the regular work environment, it has become indispensable, in addition to documents in paper form also carry information technology, be it z. As notebook, smartphone, tablet, removable hard disk or USB stick. When traveling for business, especially when traveling abroad, there are a variety of information security threats and risks that do not exist in normal business operations.

Each trip is fundamentally different, because of the dependency on parameters, such as the purpose of the trip (eg business meeting, conference, congress, seminar), the duration of the trip and the destination, each time a new threat situation, also in terms of protection more business critical Information, results.

The protection of operational information is not always easy to realize due to the constantly changing destination destinations, certain circumstances or regulatory and legal requirements. So z. For example, the legal and regulatory requirements affect entry control and thus the protection of the confidentiality of data. This shows that, depending on the type and duration of the journey and the destination, individual information security requirements arise. Political, social, religious, geographical, climatic, legal and regulatory peculiarities of individual travel destinations play a decisive role here.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to protect all information that is carried on foreign travel, both in electronic and physical form, in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Confidential information that every traveling employee carries in their head is also part of this module. Therefore, the creation of appropriate regulations and measures for dealing with sensitive information and data on trips abroad with the involvement of other relevant conditions, such. IT, data protection, law, essential.

As a result, this module highlights scenario-specific hazards and requirements that are directly related to the secure use of information technology, the information, and the devices that process them on trips abroad.

This module serves as an orientation guide for the institution responsible for the establishment of appropriate security measures in the context of information security on trips abroad. It identifies the main principles to be considered in this context. Many of these threats are also valid for domestic travel or, in principle, for the processing of information in foreign or uncontrolled environments.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The building block basically includes the requirements that contribute to adequate protection of information on trips abroad. The protection of the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information on travel has the same importance as at the headquarters of the institution.

Threats and requirements that affect the local information network are not considered here.

As the module CON.6 * Information Security on Foreign Travel * specifically considers the procedural, technical and organizational requirements that are specific to traveling on business, requirements of the layers Networks and Communication (NET), IT Systems (SYS) and Applications (APP) not considered. All necessary components, especially SYS.2.1 * General Clients, NET.3.3 VPN, SYS 3.2.2 Mobile Device Management, * must be considered separately.

In addition, the requirements from the topic-overlapping building blocks * INF.10 Mobile Workplace and INF.9 Teleworkplace * must be observed and implemented.

Within this module, there are also overlaps with other modules and topics that are not considered here:

* Compliance with privacy requirements
* Preventive measures to protect information (including technical requirements for portable IT systems, eg anti-radiation / anti-interference)
* Personnel safety

Described below are the specific information security threats and vulnerabilities that are of particular importance on overseas trips.

The threat situation is particularly elevated for some threats due to this scenario. This results z. B. from communication via public networks, which are not in the access of their own institution. As a result, dangers are again relevant against which the institution v
