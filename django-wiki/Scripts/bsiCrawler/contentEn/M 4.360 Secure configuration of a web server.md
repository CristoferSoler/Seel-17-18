#M 4.360 Secure configuration of a web server
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

After a web server service has been installed on a web server, a secure basic configuration must be made. For example, how to include additional modules and how to access directories within and outside the file system area with the published information, as well as settings that affect the performance of the server.



## Examples 
* Has a secure basic configuration been made on the web server?
* Can the web server only access information that is inside the WWW root directory?
* Can the web server only read the stored information by reading?
* Are the administration accesses to the web server protected, so that only authorized administrators can access them?
* Was it checked which network services, applications and web server modules were installed and activated on the web server and were all unnecessary services, applications and modules deactivated or completely uninstalled?
* Is access restricted to a minimum, depending on the authorized users and the protection requirements of the information?
* Is the integrity and confidentiality of the information transmitted between the web server and the client protected?
