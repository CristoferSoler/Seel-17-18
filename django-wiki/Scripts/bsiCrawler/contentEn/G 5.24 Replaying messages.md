#G 5.24 Replaying messages
Attackers record messages in this type of attack and replay them at a later time (replay attacks). This can be used to cause seemingly real messages to allow IT systems or applications to allow unauthorized accesses. This is possible because the system assumes an existing and already authorized communication.

Encrypted messages can also be restored if they do not contain any dynamic, ie changeable, information such as random numbers, sequence numbers or timestamps.

Examples:

* An attacker records the authentication data (such as user ID and password) during a user's login process and uses that information to gain access to a system, assuming a false identity (see also G .25.21 Trojan horses).
* To cause financial damage to the employer, an employee gives up an approved order several times.
