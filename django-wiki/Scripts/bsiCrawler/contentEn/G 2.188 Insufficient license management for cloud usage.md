#G 2.188 Insufficient license management for cloud usage
In the context of license management, for an institution, including the use of cloud services, there is a need to define clear responsibilities. The issue of licenses, however, is often not sufficiently considered when using the cloud.

Without clear regulation, for which licenses the using institution and for which the cloud service provider is responsible, legal consequences threaten. In the case of license tests, no valid proof of the legal use of the licenses used may be provided under certain circumstances. In order to avoid financial claims or other consequences, the institution should be able to provide information on which licenses it has brought into the cloud service and which licenses are obtained from the cloud service provider or are within its area of ??responsibility.



## Examples 
* One institution needs a total of 500 Windows servers. 300 of these servers are operated with licenses purchased directly from the institution. The remaining 200 licenses for operating the servers are obtained from the cloud service provider.
* The use of an Office Web application makes it easy to determine the required number of licenses for internal users. However, the number of externally required licenses is unclear to the institution. As a result, employees may use the Office Web application only for internal purposes.
