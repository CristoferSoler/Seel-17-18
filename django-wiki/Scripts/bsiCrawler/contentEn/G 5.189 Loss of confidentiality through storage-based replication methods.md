#G 5.189 Loss of confidentiality through storage-based replication methods
Storage-based replication methods originally have the purpose of duplicating stored or archived data in real-time over a storage network, thus creating additional redundancies. This prevents the loss of data.

However, the automated replication of unshared data entails risks both in the campus network itself and in the use of public network providers. Both IP replication and FC replication could allow attackers to exploit storage-based replication vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the data.

The following attack scenarios are fundamentally to be distinguished:

* Unauthorized access is to legitimate replication traffic, such as by using FC analyzers (FC replication) or sniffers (IP replication). See also G 5.7 Monitoring of cables.
* An attacker initiates unauthorized replication with a system he controls as a target.
* An attacker gains access to an existing replication if it is not or only insufficiently protected.
