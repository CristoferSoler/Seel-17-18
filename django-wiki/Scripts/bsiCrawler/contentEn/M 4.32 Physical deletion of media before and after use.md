#M 4.32 Physical deletion of media before and after use
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: specialist responsible

In addition to the selection of suitable methods for deletion or destruction of data containing deletions or destruction of data carriers, the following points must be observed for the data carrier exchange:

Magnetic media intended for replacement should be physically erased before writing to the information to be transmitted. This is to ensure that no residual data is passed on, for the receipt of which the receiver has no authorization.

A physical deletion sufficient for the normal protection requirement can be achieved by overwriting the complete data carrier or at least the areas used with a specific pattern. It is also possible to format the data carrier if it can not be reset. It should be avoided to delete only individual files, this often remains residual information obtained that allow the reconstruction of the deleted files.

As a rule, the transmitted data is also worthwhile for the recipient. Analogously, a physical erasure of the data carrier is also to be provided here after the data is re-imported.

The use of non-erasable data carriers (such as WORMs) shall be waived for the purposes of data exchange if there are other information not intended for the recipient which is not gel Can be deleted.
