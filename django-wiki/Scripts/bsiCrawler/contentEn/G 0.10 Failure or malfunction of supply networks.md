#G 0.10 Failure or malfunction of supply networks
In a building, there are a multitude of networks that serve the basic supply and disposal and thus as a basis for all business processes of an institution, including IT. Examples of such utility networks are:

* Electricity,
* Phone,
* Khlung,
* Heating or ventilation,
* Water and sewage,
* Lschwasserspeisungen,
* Gas,
* Signaling and control systems (eg for burglary, fire, home automation) and
* Intercoms.


The failure or disruption of a supply network can, among other things, mean that people can no longer work in the building or that the IT operation and thus the information processing is impaired.

The networks are dependent on each other in different degrees, so that operational disruptions in each individual network can have an impact on others.



## Examples 
* A failure of heating or ventilation can result in all employees having to leave the affected buildings. This may cause a lot of damage.
* The failure of the power supply affects not only the IT directly, but also to all other networks, which are equipped with electrically operated control technology. Even in drains, electric lift pumps may be present.
* The failure of the water supply may affect the function of air conditioners.
