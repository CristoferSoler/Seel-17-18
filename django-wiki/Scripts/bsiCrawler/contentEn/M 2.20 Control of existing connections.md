Responsible for initiation: Head of Domestic Engineering, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of Domestic Engineering, Planner

All distributors and drawbars of the wiring must be regularly subjected to a (at least random) visual inspection. The following points should be noted:

* Traces of violent opening attempts on sealed distributors,
* Updating of the documentation in the distributor,
* Correspondence of the actual wiring and wiring with the documentation,
* Integrity of short circuits and earthing of unused lines and
* inadmissible installations or changes.


In addition to the pure visual inspection, a functional control can additionally be carried out. Existing links are tested for their necessity and compliance with technical values. For connections that are not in access protected areas, this check is advisable in two cases:

* For connections that are used very rarely and in which manipulations are not recognized immediately.
* For connections where frequently and regularly valuable information is transmitted.


Any irregularities identified during visual inspections or functional checks must be promptly documented and reported to the relevant organizational units so that the necessary further steps can be taken in a timely manner. It is also important that the detected irregularities are not only eliminated, but also that their causes are determined.
