All employees must be informed about the peculiarities of the transmission of information by fax as well as be informed that the legally binding nature of a fax transmission is severely restricted. When using conventional fax machines, an understandable instruction manual should be available on the fax machine. When using a fax server, users should receive at least a quick reference to the fax client software they are using.

* who is the person responsible for the fax and thus responsible for the manual distribution of incoming fax transmissions and as a contact person in fax problem cases,
* who is allowed to use the fax machine or fax server,
* that a uniform fax form should be used,

* that for outgoing faxes that are sent via a fax server, a printout must be made for the files or they must be archived electronically,
* that the address books and distribution lists are checked regularly, so that the faxes are not accidentally sent to wrong recipients.
