#G 2.165 Lack of or insufficient data avoidance and data parity in the processing of personal data
Data avoidance and data economy are basic requirements that must be observed when determining the type, scope and duration of the data to be collected, processed or used. At the same time, they are also specifications for the technical design and its selection. A violation of this principle may occur, inter alia, by:

* Collection of more data than is needed for the processing path (eg more than two communication addresses such as postal address, telephone number and e-mail address for contract purposes).
* Processing of data in greater detail than required (eg processing of date of birth or credit card number if only confirmation of an age of more than 18 years is required).
* Processing and storage of personal data over a longer period of time than is necessary for the intended use (eg security analysis of log files of a firewall).


Whenever possible, the possibilities of anonymisation and pseudonymisation should be used.
