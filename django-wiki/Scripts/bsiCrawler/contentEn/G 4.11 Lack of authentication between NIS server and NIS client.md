#G 4.11 Lack of authentication between NIS server and NIS client
If one knows the NIS domain name, each computer can be registered as a client, and all NIS maps, especially the passwd map, can be retrieved.

If it is possible to get administration rights on a computer, it can be used to start an NIS server process (ypserv) on a privileged port. If you restart the client process ypbind on the computer to be infiltrated and ensure that your own server process responds to the correct NIS server, any information can be transferred to the client.

Stand: 1st EL as of January 2000
