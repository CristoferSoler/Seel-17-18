#M 2.21 smoking ban
Responsible for initiation: Head of Domestic Engineering

Responsible for implementation: employees

In most businesses and public areas, smoking is generally banned, most often by law. In Germany, for example, the Workplace Ordinance obliges most institutions to guarantee non-smoking protection at the workplace. Even in buildings where there is no comprehensive smoking ban, it must be ensured that in rooms with IT or data media (server room, data archive, but also document archive) in which fire or contamination is too high could lead to a smoking ban being issued. This smoking ban also serves preventive fire protection as well as the operational safety of IT with mechanical functional units.

It must be ensured that access protection is not compromised as a result of a smoking ban in the building. It is common to observe that outside doors are always open in hard-to-see areas because the door is close to the smoking area and the door is never closed during work hours for convenience.
