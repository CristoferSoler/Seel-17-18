#G 4.86 Insufficient traceability of security-related events in web applications
If security-related events are insufficiently logged by the Web application, they can not be traced at a later time and the cause can no longer be determined. If necessary, critical errors and attacks go unnoticed and the elimination of a vulnerability is then not possible or only under difficult conditions.

Furthermore, if events are only logged to a limited extent at the system and network level, security-related incidents are difficult to detect and reconstruct.

Examples:

* Security relevant events of the web application are not logged or only limited. So unauthorized configuration changes (eg by an attacker) go undetected.


* Not all the necessary properties of an event are logged, so that operations can not be fully understood (eg only the date, but no time).


* If the protection of the log data is not guaranteed, it can be manipulated unnoticed. Thus, an attacker can clear hints on actions taken and the attack remains undetected or is no longer traceable.
