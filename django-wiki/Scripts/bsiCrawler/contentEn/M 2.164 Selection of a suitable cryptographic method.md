#M 2.164 Selection of a suitable cryptographic method
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

The selection of a cryptographic method falls into the two subtasks

* Selection of the cryptographic algorithm and
* Selection of a technical realization.


Before users commit to specific procedures, they should have clear ideas about the requirements they place on the confidentiality and authenticity of the processed data in each point of their information processing system.



## Examples 
* Symmetric Encryption: The advantages and disadvantages of symmetric methods are described in M 3.23 Introduction to Cryptographic Basic Concepts. Suitable algorithms are, for example, AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
* asymmetric encryption: The advantages and disadvantages of asymmetric methods are also described in M 3.23 Introduction to Basic Cryptographic Terms. Suitable algorithms are z. B. RSA or elliptic curve-based encryption methods (for key length, see below).
