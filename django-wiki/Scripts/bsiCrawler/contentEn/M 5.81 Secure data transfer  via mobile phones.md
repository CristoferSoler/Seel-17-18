Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: user, IT security officer

Mobile phones are used for voice transmission, but data and faxes can be transmitted as well. For some of these services, additional accessories will be needed. Modern mobile phones are usually permanently connected to the Internet to receive chat messages or emails. If mobile phones use the LTE standard, all communication is realized as data transmission over the Internet Protocol (IP).



## Examples 
* the storage space of the mobile phone can be overloaded by received faxes,
* Depending on the importance of faxing, it may be necessary to make copies of it, which may be difficult on the mobile phone,
* it may be useful to block the numbers of certain fax recipients or senders.
