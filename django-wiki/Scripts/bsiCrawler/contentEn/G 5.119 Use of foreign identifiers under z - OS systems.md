#G 5.119 Use of foreign identifiers under z / OS systems
The surrogate privilege of the z / OS security system RACF allows a user A to run a batch job under the identity of another user B without user A knowing the user's password. All security checks are made for the user ID and the protocol and SMF data is recorded by user B as the executor of the commands.

There is a risk that the permission surrogate will be used improperly, if the necessary security precautions during the assignment and the monitoring are not observed:

* Users can u. U. carry out unauthorized actions to which they are not entitled with their own identifier.
* Users can u. U. pretend that another user is responsible for their own (unauthorized) actions.
