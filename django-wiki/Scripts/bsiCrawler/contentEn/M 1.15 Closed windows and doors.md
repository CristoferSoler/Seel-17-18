#M 1.15 Closed windows and doors
Responsible for initiation: Head of Domestic Engineering

Responsible for implementation: building services, employees

Windows and outward doors (balconies, terraces) must be closed in times when a room is not occupied. External doors are to be completed. In the basement and ground floor and, depending on the design of the façade, also on the higher floors, open windows and doors offer burglars ideal entry points, which are also used during the operating hours of an institution.

Employees should be advised that windows and doors must be closed when leaving the premises. If, during normal working hours, it is ensured that the rooms are only temporarily empty, it is not possible to have a mandatory room for meeting rooms, meeting rooms, event rooms or training rooms.

No exception may be allowed for fire and smoke protection doors. Such doors provide protection only when locked and therefore must never be kept permanently open by wedges or other devices.

It makes sense for gardeners or employees of the building services to check regularly whether the windows and doors have been closed after leaving the rooms.

In meeting, event and training rooms, there is usually no way to include documents, IT systems and the like separately. Therefore, it should be possible to have such rooms closed or at least supervised by an internal employee, if all participants leave the room.
