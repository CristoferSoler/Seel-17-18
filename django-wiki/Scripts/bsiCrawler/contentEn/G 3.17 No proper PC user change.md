#G 3.17 No proper PC user change
If several users are working on a PC, negligence or convenience may mean that the previous user does not log off when the user changes and the new one does not log in properly. This is usually explained by those concerned that the time it takes the IT system to restart is very long and unacceptable.

However, this misconduct leads to the fact that the logging of logon and logoff operations and thus part of the preservation of evidence becomes ineffective. It is no longer possible to reliably determine from the logs who used the computer at any given time.



## Examples 
* A PC is used alternately by three users to make travel expenses. After the first user completes the login process, the user will no longer be able to properly change the PC because the logoff and logon procedures will not be performed for convenience.
* Due to irregularities it is checked who has processed which process on the computer. Since only one user has worked on the PC after logging, the causer can no longer be identified afterwards or the only registered user must bear the consequences.
