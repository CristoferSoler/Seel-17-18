#M 2.19 Neutral documentation in the distributors
Responsible for initiation: Head of Domestic Engineering

Responsible for implementation: Head of Domestic Engineering, Planner

Each distributor should have documentation that reflects the current status of shunting and line assignments. This documentation should be kept as neutral as possible. Only existing and used connections should be listed. Unless expressly required (eg for fire alarm lines), no information should be given on the type of use of the lines. Line, distribution and room numbers are sufficient in many cases. All further information must be listed in a revision documentation.
