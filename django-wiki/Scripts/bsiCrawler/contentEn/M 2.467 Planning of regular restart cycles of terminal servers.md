#M 2.467 Planning of regular restart cycles of terminal servers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

To ensure trouble-free operation of terminal servers, regular restart cycles should be scheduled. During the controlled shutdown and restart, maintenance work can be carried out in a scripted way. In addition, this process limits the impact of any memory leaks that can reduce the terminal servers' performance over time.

In large terminal server configurations, restart cycles should not be performed on all terminal servers at a common time to distribute loads on the management servers during recovery over a longer period of time. In addition, terminal servers running active user sessions should be excluded from the reboot.

To do this, create a startup plan based on the current build of the terminal server environment.
