#M 2.16 Supervision or accompaniment of third parties
Responsible for initiation: Head of Organization

Responsible for implementation: employees

Persons not belonging to the institution, such as visitors, craftsmen, maintenance and cleaning personnel, should not be left unattended, except in premises expressly intended for this purpose (see also M 2.6 Assignment of access authorizations). All employees should be cautioned that they must take care of outsiders they encounter unattended within the agency or the company from that moment on. This not only serves the safety of everyone, but is also a positive service aspect for non-employees.

If it becomes necessary to leave an external person alone in the office, a colleague should be invited into the room or the visitor to a colleague.

If it is not possible to constantly accompany or supervise other persons (eg cleaning staff), at least the personal work area should be closed: desk, cabinet and PC (access lock activated), see also M 2.37 The tidy workplace.

For the home office, family members and visitors are only allowed to be alone in the work area if all work documents are kept locked up and the IT is secured via an activated access protection.

The necessity of this measure should be explained to the employees and kept in a safety guideline. A documentation about the stay of foreign persons can be led in a visitor's book.
