#M 5.26 Telephone announcement of a fax transmission
Initiation Initiation: IT Security Officer, Supervisor

Responsible for implementation: users

Important faxes with confidential or financial content (eg offers) or on-time faxes should be registered before sending them to the addressee (for example by telephone). The recipient then has the option of going to the appropriate fax machine and receiving the incoming fax directly, so that no one else can pick up the fax.

Users should be instructed by supervisors to announce confidential or important fax transmissions.
