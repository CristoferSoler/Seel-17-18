#M 4.244 Secure system configuration of Windows client operating systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The security of a workstation essentially depends on whether a user can administratively affect the computer, which functions are made available to the users and whether the users correctly use the security mechanisms provided to them.

When configuring clients as of Windows XP, the following aspects should be considered from the security point of view:

* The corresponding monitoring guidelines must be defined (see S 4.148 Monitoring a Windows 2000 / XP system and S 4.344 Monitoring clients as of Windows Vista and servers as of Windows Server 2008). The collected log data must also be evaluated regularly.
* When used in an Active Directory environment, the rights to add workstations to the domain should be restricted. Only authorized administrative users may have this responsibility. The restriction of the right takes place via the guideline Computer configuration | Windows Settings | Security Settings | Local Policies | Assign User Rights | Add workstations to the domain.
* When using client operating systems from Windows XP on mobile computers, additional security risks arise, which should be mitigated by special precautions (see S 2.328 Use of Windows XP on mobile computers, M 2.442 Use of Windows from Windows Vista on mobile systems, as well B 3.3 laptop).
