Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

For Windows 7 clients, Windows offers various network features that are primarily intended for home users and that are enabled by default. Since Windows 7 access credentials for various resources, such as external computer systems and web pages, and personal information (Windows Cardspace) for the registration and registration of websites and online services can be managed. Windows Cardspace with the introduction of Windows 8 is no longer part of the operating system and has been completely removed.

In order to avoid weaknesses by using these functionalities within an institution, the risks to their use must first be weighed against their use. In the case of a positive decision regarding the use, the use of the functions must be carefully planned and implemented.



## Examples 
* Does Windows 7 and Windows 7 have a policy for storing access data in the so-called vault?
* For Windows clients as of Windows 7, has Group Policy been configured for the behavior of the Credential Management service according to the policy?
* Is there a policy for using Windows Cardspace on Windows 7?
* Has the Group Policy for the behavior of the Windows Cardspace service on Windows 7 been configured according to the policy?
