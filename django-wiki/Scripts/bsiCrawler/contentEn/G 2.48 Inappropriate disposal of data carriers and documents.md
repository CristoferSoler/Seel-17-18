#G 2.48 Inappropriate disposal of data carriers and documents
If data carriers or documents are not properly disposed of, information may be extracted from them that should not be in the hands of third parties.



## Examples 
* Attackers do not always have to deal with complicated technical attacks to get information about vulnerabilities in IT systems. Much easier and more successful can be the information collection from the dumpster (Dumpster Diving). B rom ll, such as diskettes, CD-ROMs, internal telephone books or even the current track record, is generally not very dirty and can contain a lot of interesting and reusable information.
* CD-ROMs can be returned for recycling in many places. Unfortunately, it is often not considered here that even CD-ROMs with old data backups or other files for external users can contain interesting information. The scratching of the surface is not enough here to prevent those interested in the evaluation of information successfully.
