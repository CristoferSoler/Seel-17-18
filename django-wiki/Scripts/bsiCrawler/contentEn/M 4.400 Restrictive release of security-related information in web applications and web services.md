#M 4.400 Restrictive release of security-related information in web applications and web services
Responsible for initiation: Specialists, responsible for the individual applications

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer

Web pages and Web service web pages and responses can include security-related information that helps attackers bypass security mechanisms and exploit vulnerabilities. Therefore, security-relevant information that is not necessarily required for the operation and use of the web application or the web service must be displayed.

The following examples illustrate what information can contain security-relevant information and how it can be prevented from being disclosed.



## Examples 
* Stack traces and debugging information,
* Messages such as username invalid or password invalid (invalid instead of general error messages such as username or password),
* error messages passed on by background systems, such as SQL error messages of a database instead of a message Error in checking the access data,
* Error codes instead of, for example, the message An error has occurred.
