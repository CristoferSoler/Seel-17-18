#M 1.31 Remote display of faults
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, PBX manager, IT manager

IT devices and support devices, which require no or only a rare operation by a person, are often housed in locked and closed rooms (eg server room). As a result, disruptions that are not yet affecting IT at their early stages and are easy to fix are only too late, mostly through their impact on IT. Fire, malfunctions of a UPS or the failure of an air conditioning unit are cited as examples of such creeping dangers.

A remote display makes it possible to detect such faults earlier. Many devices that you have to rely on, without being able to constantly test or monitor them, today have a connection for remote control displays. The technical possibilities range from simple contacts, via which a warning lamp can be switched on, to computer interfaces with an associated software package for the common operating systems. Often it is even possible via the interfaces to determine the current operating state of the connected devices at any time and thus be able to counteract precipitations in good time.
