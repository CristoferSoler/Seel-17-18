#G 5.178 Abuse of administrator rights in cloud management
Cloud management, which is controlled by the cloud management server, must provide capabilities and resources to manage cloud resources. This includes driving physical and virtual cloud resources to make configurations manually or automatically. The management server controls the provisioning and de-provisioning of cloud services, registers the cloud services for cloud tenants, and serves as the central directory for cloud services.

The cloud management server's ability to influence the cloud services is far-reaching and can lead to abuse of cloud management capabilities.

Abusive administration occurs when administrative privileges are exploited (whether legally or illegally acquired) to harm the cloud infrastructure or its users.



## Examples 
* The capabilities of the cloud management server allow you to map storage spaces or virtual machines. From this, unauthorized copies can be made and removed from the secured cloud environments without authorization.
* The cloud management software can use the virtualization functions to write processor leases and memory contents to the storage system or to the storage server of the management server.
* The virtual machines for cloud services can be interrupted unauthorized.
* The function of freezing (creating so-called snapshots) of virtual machines and cloud services may be misused to circumvent security measures.
