#M 4.210 Secure operation of the z / OS operating system
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

A z / OS operating system normally runs largely autonomously without intervention by the operating personnel. However, to safeguard the operation, there are some measures that must necessarily be taken if the functions of a z / OS operating system are to be available without any problems:



## Examples 
* Is z / OS regularly checking the Host Management Console for errors reported there?
* Are WTOR messages monitored to ensure that any new requests from the z / OS operating system are promptly answered, if necessary?
* Is it ensured that all planned system tasks of the z / OS system are active?
* Are system utilization and compliance with the planned capacity limits of the z / OS system properly monitored?
* Will compliance with security requirements for the z / OS system be monitored?
* Will z / OS system messages be reduced so that only important messages are displayed?
* Will maintenance work on the z / OS system be coordinated with all involved specialists via a comprehensible change management procedure?
* Is a method such as SMP / E used for software installation on z / OS?
* Are the z / OS system commands protected by corresponding RACF profiles, so that only authorized persons can execute these commands?
* Are the staff responsible for operating the z / OS system sufficiently trained?
