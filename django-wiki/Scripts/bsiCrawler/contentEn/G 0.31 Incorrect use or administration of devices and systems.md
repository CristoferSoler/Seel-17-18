#G 0.31 Incorrect use or administration of devices and systems
Improper or improper use of devices, systems and applications may compromise their safety, especially if existing security measures are disregarded or circumvented. This often leads to faults or failures. Depending on which types of devices or systems are misused, however, the confidentiality and integrity of information may also be violated.

A particularly important special case of incorrect use is incorrect administration. Failure to install, configure, maintain, and maintain hardware or software components can cause serious harm.

For example, overprivileged rights, easy-to-guess passwords, insufficiently protected data carriers with backup copies, or unauthorized terminals in the event of temporary absence can lead to security incidents.

Likewise, erroneous operation of IT systems or applications may cause data to be deleted or altered accidentally. As a result, however, confidential information could also reach the public, for example if access rights are set incorrectly.

If power or mains cables are laid unprotected, they can be inadvertently damaged, causing connections to fail. Appliance connection cables can be torn out if employees or visitors stumble over it.
