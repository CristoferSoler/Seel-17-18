#M 2.451 Planning the DNS deployment
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

A basic requirement for the safe use of DNS servers is adequate planning in advance. For this purpose, a concept must first be created, which should contain, among other things, how to build DNS and which domain information is worth protecting. Planning does not only concern aspects that are classically associated with the term security, but also normal operational aspects that may entail safety requirements. Information on the structure and basic structure of DNS is provided by the M 2.450 introduction to basic DNS concepts.
