#G 2.82 Incorrect planning of the installation site of storage and archive systems
Due to the sensitivity of the stored data as well as the very long storage time, storage or archive systems have to make considerable demands on the quality of data storage. The choice of the place of installation for the storage or the archive system has a high influence on this.

In this context, the following potential security problems should be considered:

* Inadequate climatic conditionsA high or too low temperature, as well as excessive humidity, can cause malfunctions in the technical components of archive and storage systems and damage to archive and storage media. Frequent fluctuations in climatic conditions increase this effect. Secondary damage can also cause such climatic loads. An example of this is the thinning of walls, which can occur after a fire in the neighboring room.
* Insufficient physical protectionBy insufficient protection of the storage or archiving system against unauthorized access and access, beneficial actions (eg theft, tampering or sabotage) can be promoted.
* Inadequate protection against other environmental influencesOther environmental influences (eg shocks or high levels of dust) can cause damage to the technical components of the archive system or to storage media. This is particularly annoying when the damaging effects were even predictable, such as: B. in construction.
