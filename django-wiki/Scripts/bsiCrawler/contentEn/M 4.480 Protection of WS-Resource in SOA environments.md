#M 4.480 Protection of WS-Resource in SOA environments
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Using the OASIS Web Services Resource (WS-Resource) standard, services can be further enhanced. Thus, the standard sets various parameters that indicate whether a service is usable or, if necessary, locked.

For the origin of the parameter values ??for WS-Resource, there are two possibilities.

* Parameter values ??are set directly in connection with the associated service, e.g. B. A service may be used with Classification Open, Level 1 or equivalent.
* Parameter values ??are derived from other resources outside of the SOA environment, e.g. B. Transmission speed of a communication port. If resources are used in the SOA system that are defined with a lower degree of classification than the SOA system itself, a transition from classification level 1 to classification level 2 is given. In this case, data of classification level 1 are also imported into an environment of classification level 2.


Consideration should be given to protecting the WS-Resource information through the recommendations described in action M 4.478 Key Management in SOA.

In the case of the transition from classification level 1 to classification level 2, additional plausibility checks must be integrated, depending on the normal behavior of the lower classified resource.
