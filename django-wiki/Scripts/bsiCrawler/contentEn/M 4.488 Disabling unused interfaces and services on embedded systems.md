Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Administrator

Embedded systems are often equipped with a large number of different interfaces. In addition to simple inputs / outputs for sensor and actuator connection, network communication, operating and display interfaces of varying complexity can be found.



## Examples 
* Are only required physical interfaces available?
* Are only required services activated?
* Is access to application interfaces protected by secure authentication?
