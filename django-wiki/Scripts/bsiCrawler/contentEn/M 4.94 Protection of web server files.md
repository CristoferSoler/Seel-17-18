#M 4.94 Protection of web server files
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The files and directories on a web server must be protected against unauthorized changes, but also - depending on the security requirements - against unauthorized read access. If content is generated dynamically on the web server, this applies additionally and especially to the programs (scripts or server extensions) that are used for this purpose.



## Examples 
* Are files and directories on a web server protected against unauthorized reading and writing?
* Checking the integrity of files and directories by means of checksums: Are the checksums of the files and directories regularly checked?
* Dynamic Content Creation: Are content creation programs securely programmed and securely stored on the server so they can not gain unauthorized access to the server?
* Are scripts and configuration files unreadable for ordinary users?
* When authenticating clients via computers or domain names: Are measures taken against DNS spoofing and pharming?
* Client authentication via IP addresses: Are connections from proxy servers only considered trustworthy if all IT systems behind the proxy are trustworthy?
* Passwords protect WWW files: Is a suitable user authentication method chosen, depending on the security requirements?
