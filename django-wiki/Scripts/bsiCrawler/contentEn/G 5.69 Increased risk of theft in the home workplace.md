#G 5.69 Increased risk of theft in the home workplace
The home office is generally not as well secured as the workplace in a company or a public authority. There is, due to more complex precautions such as the use of security doors, burglary protection or the Pf rtnerdienst, the risk of someone entering the building without authorization, much less than a private home.

The goal of burglary and theft in private homes is usually enrichment. As a result, items such as jewelry or IT equipment are stolen, which can be sold quickly and easily. It can also be stolen official IT equipment. However, the information available on the stolen official IT systems generally has a higher value than the IT systems themselves. Burglars could try to obtain a higher return by extorting or distributing the data to competing companies than by selling the hardware.
