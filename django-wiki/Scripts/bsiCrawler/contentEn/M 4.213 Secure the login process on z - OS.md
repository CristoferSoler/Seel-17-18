#M 4.213 Secure the login process on z / OS
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Access to z / OS systems - especially the login process - must be protected. Please note the following recommendations:

* All services and ports not required for access should be blocked. Consideration should be given to restrict access to the services and ports required by RACF profiles to the authorized accessibility.
* The handling of passwords should be done as described in measure M 2.11 Control of password usage. When accessing from public networks (Internet) to z / OS systems, it must be prevented that all identifiers are blocked by incorrect entry of passwords. This can currently only be solved by the use of digital certificates. It should be considered whether the automation of the RACF Reply should be omitted for identifiers with the attribute SPECIAL for security reasons. This prevents all identifiers with SPECIAL attribute from being automatically locked.
* The SYS1.UADS file is used to ensure that system access is still possible if the RACF fails. Only the IBMUSER or one or more emergency users may be entered in this file.


In addition, the recommendations described in M 4.15 Secured Login apply.
