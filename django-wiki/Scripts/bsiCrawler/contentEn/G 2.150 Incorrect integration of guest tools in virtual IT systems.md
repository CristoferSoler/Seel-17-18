#G 2.150 Incorrect integration of guest tools in virtual IT systems
By means of guest tools, wiez. For example, using Citrix XenTools or VMware Tools, the virtual IT infrastructure in the virtualization infrastructure can be controlled and managed by the administrator from the virtualization server. Furthermore, these programs integrate drivers and services for communicating the virtualized operating systems with the host.

Using the guest tools various functions are realized, such as:

* Synchronization of the system time of a virtual machine with the host,
* Request for main memory in the virtual IT system and release of this memory for other guests on the virtualization server (Ballooning),
* Shut down the operating system of the virtual IT system without logging in,
* Optimization of virtual hard disks (thin provisioning).


In the context of the virtual machine, the guest tools have extensive privileges on system files and services to enable the functions described. These functions can contradict an established authorization concept as well as further requirements for the virtual environment if the existing concepts and requirements are not observed and implemented when planning the installation of the guest tools. This may allow the use of features that are incompatible with the organization's policies.
