#G 0.28 Software vulnerabilities or errors
For any software, the more complex it is, the more often errors occur. Even with intensive tests, not all errors are usually discovered before delivery to the customer. If software errors are not detected in time, the failures or errors arising during the application can lead to far-reaching consequences. Examples of this are incorrect calculation results, wrong decisions of the management level and delays in the course of the business processes.

Software vulnerabilities or errors can lead to serious security gaps in an application, an IT system or all IT systems connected to it. Such vulnerabilities may be exploited under circumstances of attackers to inject malicious software, unauthorized read data or tampering.



## Examples 
* Most Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) alerts in recent years have referred to security-related programming errors. These are errors that arise when creating software and cause this software to be misused by attackers. A large part of these errors was caused by memory overflows (buffer overflow).
* Internet browsers are now an important software component on clients. Browsers are often used not only for accessing the Internet, but also for internal web applications in companies and authorities. Software vulnerabilities or errors in browsers can therefore have a particularly significant impact on information security overall.
