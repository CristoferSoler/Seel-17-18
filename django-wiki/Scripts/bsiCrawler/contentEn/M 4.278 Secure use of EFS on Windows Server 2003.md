#M 4.278 Secure use of EFS on Windows Server 2003
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

The Encrypting File System (EFS) of Windows Server 2003 / XP is an easy-to-use means for users to work with encrypted files regardless of application. It is best for individual users and exposed client computers that are temporarily out of the protected IT environment. The main intention is to establish confidentiality for dedicated local data. The basics are M 4.147 Secure use of EFS under Windows.

Less suitable is EFS for the large-scale encryption of centralized user data on remote servers, such as file servers. This can only be realized with special key management planning. Considerable effort is required to secure and protect large amounts of data and a large number of user keys.



## Examples 
* The predefined administrator account must not be provided with a DRA certificate
* User accounts that assume the role of DRA should generally not have administrator rights
* There are as few data recovery agents as possible to create
* It is always a separate account for use as a DRA to use
