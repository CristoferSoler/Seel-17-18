#M 4.442 Central protection against malicious programs in the cloud infrastructure
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Due to the high concentration of data and applications in a cloud infrastructure, in addition to the local protection against malicious programs, a central component for the defense against malicious programs has to be operated.

This central protection against malicious programs (virus protection) must be set up at the central access points to the network of the cloud service provider. This should be done using an Application Level Gateway (ALG). For this, the measure M 4.226 Integration of virus scanners in a security gateway should be used and implemented.

It is recommended to select a protection program from a vendor for central protection against malicious programs, rather than for local protection, in order to maximize the detection rate of malicious programs.
