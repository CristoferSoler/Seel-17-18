#G 2.85 Insufficient regulations for the end of an outsourcing or cloud use project
If an institution uses the services of an outsourcing or cloud service provider, it usually results in a loss of know-how at the client and a dependence of the client on the service provider. Therefore, inadequate regulations for a possible termination of the contractual relationship may have serious consequences for the client. Experience has shown that this is always particularly problematic when a client critical case unexpectedly occurs, such as bankruptcy or sale of the outsourcing or cloud service provider.



## Examples 
* A competitor of the client buys the outsourcing or cloud service provider.
* A national security agency has outsourced processes to a data center, which is later purchased by a foreign company.
* There are legal disputes between client and service provider due to poor service quality or serious safety defects, as a result of which a contracting party wishes to terminate the contract.
