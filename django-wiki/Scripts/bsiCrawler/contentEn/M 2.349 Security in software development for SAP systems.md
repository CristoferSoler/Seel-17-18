#M 2.349 Security in software development for SAP systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer

In order to adapt an SAP system to the specific needs of a company or a public authority, the function of the system can be changed or extended by in-house developments. The following must be considered from a security point of view during software development for SAP systems:



## Examples 
* ABAP code must always check permissions.
* The own and used authorization objects in the ABAP code must be documented and must be entered using the transaction SU24 for the profile generator (see also M 2.342 Planning for SAP Authorizations).
* For Java code, the services used are to be documented.
* The roles and specifications used for the so-called security constraints (that is, which roles are necessary for access to application functions) must be documented for Java applications.
* For ABAP programs, the ABAP Code Inspector (transaction SCI) should be used to check your own programs for, among other things, security and compliance with SAP naming conventions. This is especially true if no other tools are used to perform security-related checks of ABAP programs.
