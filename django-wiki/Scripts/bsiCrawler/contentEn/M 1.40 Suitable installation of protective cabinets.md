#M 1.40 Suitable installation of protective cabinets
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: internal service

Due to the generally high weight of protective cabinets, the load-bearing capacity of the floor at the installation site must be checked before installation.

Protective cabinets, which due to their small size could be carried away relatively easily, should be anchored in the wall or in the floor.

Any existing manufacturer's instructions for suitable installation (eg free ventilation openings, cable guides) must be taken into consideration.
