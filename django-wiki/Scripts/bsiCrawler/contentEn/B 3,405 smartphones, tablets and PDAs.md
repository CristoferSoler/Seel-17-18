#B 3,405 smartphones, tablets and PDAs
## Description 
This module deals with mobile devices for data acquisition, processing and communication. These are available in different device classes, which differ according to dimensions and performance characteristics. These include:

* Organizer to manage addresses and appointments.
* PDAs with and without their own keyboard, where the data is entered via the display or the keyboard. The primary purpose is the collection and editing of appointments, e-mails, addresses and small notes.
* Smartphones, ie mobile phones with computer functions and built-in interface for data transmission. When using smartphones, module B 3.404 mobile phone and if necessary module B 3.203 laptop is also to be converted.
* Tablets, which are usually large smartphones with or without a phone function. Devices that are larger than ordinary smartphones, but even smaller than ordinary tablets are also called smartlets or phablets. The area of ??application is identical to smartphones, except that it is more convenient to process data, read documents and surf the Internet. When using tablets with a telephone function, block B 3.404 must also be used.
* The transition to real notebooks are so-called sub-notebooks (netbooks, ultrabooks, etc.), which are much smaller than normal notebooks and therefore, for example, less Peripherier te and Anschlussm glichkeiten offer, but among other things for the Vorf Are suitable for presentations. Many tablets can also be extended by a keyboard and can then be used like a laptop. When sub-notebooks or tablets are used, the B 3.203 module must also be converted to a laptop.


The transitions between the various device types are fluent and, moreover, subject to the constant change in technology. A typical requirement for smartphones, tablets and PDAs is the use of standard office applications even on the go. For this, custom variants of word processing, spreadsheet, e-mail or calendar programs are offered. However, the devices are also increasingly being used for safety-critical applications, such as use as authentication tokens for access to corporate networks (eg generation of one-time passwords), storage of patient data or the management of customer records.

This module looks at the security features of smartphones, tablets, and PDAs that are relevant to users in their use. It will show a systematic way, how smartphones, tablets and PDAs can be used safely in institutions, how security concepts for these devices should be created and developed and how, in this way, smartphones, tablets and PDAs are securely embedded in an information network can be.



## Countermeasures 


###policy recommendations
In order to safeguard the considered information network, further modules must be implemented in addition to this module, according to the results of the modeling according to IT-Grundschutz.

Smartphones, tablets and PDAs require a range of measures, from conception to procurement to operation. The phases to be followed and the actions to be taken in each phase are listed below.



###Planning and conception
In order to be able to use smartphones, tablets and PDAs safely and effectively in public agencies or companies, a concept based on the security requirements for the existing IT systems and the requirements of the planned deployment scenarios should be developed (see M  2.303 Defining a strategy for the use of smartphones, tablets or PDAs). Based on this, the use of smartphones, tablets and PDAs is to be regulated and security guidelines have to be developed (see M 2.304 Security Guidelines and Regulations for the Use of Smartphones, Tablets and PDAs). On smartphones, tablets and PDAs, various applications (apps) can be installed. The applications must be selected and executed securely (see M 4.467 Selection of applications for smartphones, tablets and PDAs).



###procurement
For the procurement of smartphones, tablets and PDAs, the requirements for the respective products resulting from the concept must be formulated and suitable devices selected based on them (see M4.305 Use of storage restrictions (quotas)). It also needs to be assessed whether to add additional security tools that can increase the security of smartphones, tablets, and PDAs to some extent (see M 4.231 Use of additional security tools for smartphones, tablets) or PDAs).



###implementation
Mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets or PDAs should also frequently access data from the Internet or the internal network of an institution while on the move. For this, additional aspects should be taken into account for the protection of the information (see M 5.121 Secure communication on the road).



###business
Depending on the security requirements, the software components involved (smartphones / tablets / PDA, synchronization software, software for central device management) must be configured differently. This applies above all to the terminals themselves (see M 4.228 Use of the security mechanisms of smartphones, tablets and PDAs), the synchronization environment (see M 4.229 Secure operation of smartphones, tablets and PDAs) and special software for the central device. Management (see M 4.230 Central Administration of Smartphones, Tablets and PDAs). In order to be able to use smartphones, tablets and PDAs safely, coupled workstations and above all the synchronization interface must be securely configured. Suitable safety recommendations for standard workstation PCs are described in the layer 3 client building blocks.



###segregation
In the event of the failure, defect, destruction or theft of a smartphone, tablet or PDA, there should be clear reporting channels and contact persons in each organization (see M 2.306 Loss Report). In addition, it is important to ensure that smartphones, tablets and PDAs are properly isolated (see M 4.465 Disposal of mobile phones, smartphones, tablets and PDAs).



###emergency preparedness
A smartphone, tablet or PDA may fail or be functional for various reasons. Therefore, appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent a failure or to minimize the problems (see M 6.95 loss prevention and data protection for smartphones, tablets and PDAs). Likewise, appropriate recommendations must be implemented so that the theft or loss does not result in lost or stolen data on the terminal (see M 6.159 Preventing loss and theft of smartphones, tablets and PDAs).

In the following, the set of measures for the use of smartphones, tablets and PDAs will be presented.
