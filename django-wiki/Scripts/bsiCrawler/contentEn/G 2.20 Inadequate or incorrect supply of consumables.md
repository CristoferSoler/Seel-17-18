#G 2.20 Inadequate or incorrect supply of consumables
Many devices used in everyday office work, such as fax machines, printers, backup drives, etc., require sufficient quantities for trouble-free and uninterrupted operation of consumables. If consumables are missing, the operation process can be severely disrupted. In emergencies, the ability to act can be severely impaired and cause high follow-up costs, because consumables are not available in sufficient quantities.



## Examples 
* Incoming facsimiles can not be printed even though they were received properly when the paper or toner supply is exhausted. The buffer memory, due to its limited storage capacity, can only remove the rejection or loss of fax transmissions, but can not prevent them in the long term.
* A new tape drive will be procured that is incompatible with the old bands. New matching bands have not been procured, so for days no backups can be made.
* An important print job is pending. However, the purchased toner cartridge does not fit the reserve for the printer.
