#M 4.93 Regular integrity check
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Regularly checking the file system, file attributes and process information, as well as other important elements of the system configuration (for example, Windows Registry) for unexpected changes helps to detect inconsistencies. The detection of such inconsistencies can be used to prevent system instabilities. It can also detect attacks in a timely manner. If there is an actual attack, it is important to reconstruct the attacker's approach. On the one hand, it serves to detect manipulation of data and, on the other hand, to detect hidden backdoors that an attacker might have installed for later access to the computer.



## Examples 
* Do the used cryptographic mechanisms of the integrity check correspond to the state of the art?
* Are the checksum file and the test program itself sufficiently protected against tampering?
* Is it ensured that important evidence of loss of integrity does not get lost in a case of irrelevant false positives?
