#M 3.12 Information of all employees about possible TK warning displays, symbols and doors
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, staff council / works council, telecommunications system manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

The meaning of the PBX warning indicators, icons and symbols should be familiar to all employees. These include in particular:

* Attention tone for direct response,
* Barge-warning tone,
* Hands-free display,
* Display for activated direct response,
* Display for automatic callback and
* Display / overlay on a three-way conference.


Since the use of certain features which are not actually released (example: witness circuit) can impair safety, their warnings and warnings should be particularly well-known.
