#G 5.123 Listening to room calls  via mobile devices
Almost all mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, PDAs and mobile phones come with built-in microphone and / or built-in camera. For example, the devices can be used to record or listen to calls unnoticed (see section 4.95 Failure of components of a memory solution). A smartphone placed in the room inconspicuously, for example in a meeting, is sufficient for this purpose.

Example:

* In a meeting, almost everyone involved has their laptops with them and use them constantly. One of the participants unobtrusively activated his computer microphone. As with most mobile devices, the other participants will not recognize that the microphone is on. He then prepares a complete recording of the meeting and cuts out smaller contributions. Since these were torn out of the context of meaning, he can thus successfully pretend another meeting result.
