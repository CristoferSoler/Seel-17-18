#M 4.395 Error handling by web applications and web services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer

If an error occurs during the operation of a web application or service, it should be treated to maintain a consistent state of the web application, thus maintaining the protection of the data.

A web application or web service is in an inconsistent state when it is unexpectedly corrupted due to an error and data is processed uncontrollably (for example, no error message if data is not saved successfully).

The consistent state of a web application or web service can be jeopardized, among other things, by the following events:

* Crash the application
* fully executed application-level transactions
* Execution of an action despite errors (for example, in the case of incomplete checks by security components)
* Prevention of services (denial of service)
* Extension of rights (privilege escalation)
* Executing malicious code (code execution)


The following points should be considered when troubleshooting:



## Examples 
* Is the web application or web service only displaying error messages that do not contain sensitive information?
* Is logging of errors planned?
* If an action initiated is aborted in the event of an error and the access to the requested resource or function is subsequently rejected?
* Does error handling provide a release of bound resources?
* Are errors treated as much as possible by the same component in which the error occurred?
