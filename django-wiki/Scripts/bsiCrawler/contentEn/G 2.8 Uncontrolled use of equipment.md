#G 2.8 Uncontrolled use of equipment
Equipment - whichever type - may only be used in accordance with the intended use. The persons responsible for the procurement and use of the equipment must both prevent uncontrolled use and monitor the correct use. However, if the use of equipment is not adequately controlled, a variety of hazards can result.



## Examples 
* The use of private data carriers by employees can lead to an infestation of the official APC by malicious programs.
* Incorrect cleaning agents can damage monitors.
* Inappropriate inkjet printer ink may cause contamination or malfunction of the printer.
* In one operation, the consumption of DVDs was not controlled. Only with a random plausibility check turned out that in the last half year unexplainably many DVDs had been consumed. When asked, it turned out that many people used it to record smaller amounts of data for data exchange. They then discarded the DVDs because they had not been told that multi-session DVDs could be used multiple times if only a small amount of data was stored on them.
