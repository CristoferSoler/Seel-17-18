#G 3.76 Error synchronizing mobile devices
Data stored on mobile IT systems such as laptops, cell phones, and PDAs is often synchronized with stationary IT systems.

However, data can also be destroyed. In general, before synchronization, you have to set how to deal with conflicts during data synchronization: for example, if the files are the same as those of the mobile device or the other device, they will be taken over unasked or queried. This is often configured once when the docking station is started up and then forgotten again. If, however, data is changed in a different order than originally thought, important information is quickly lost. This unpleasant side effect can also occur if multiple users synchronize their mobile devices with the same device, without thinking that the files of the same name can be overwritten.
