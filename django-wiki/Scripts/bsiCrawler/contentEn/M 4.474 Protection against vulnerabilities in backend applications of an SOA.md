#M 4.474 Protection against vulnerabilities in backend applications of an SOA
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Administrator

Preceding authentication and authorization mechanisms should initially limit the chances of attack on the backend applications of a service-oriented architecture (SOA). In addition, it must be ensured that already authenticated and authorized users can not attack these systems.

The backend applications are to be secured by regular updates. In addition, XML messages can be filtered to prevent harmful code from being passed or critical commands to be executed.

When selecting the XML transport container, care must therefore be taken that the securing means can be used in a way that prevents manipulation of the contents.
