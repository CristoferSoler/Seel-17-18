#M 4.62 Use of a D-channel filter
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, Procurement

A D-channel filter is switched between ISDN connection (S2M or S0) and ISDN terminal or ISDN PBX. For the ISDN connection it behaves like an ISDN terminal and the ISDN terminal like an ISDN connection. The D-channel filter monitors the ISDN D channel for inadmissible protocol actions and is thus able to detect and prevent manipulation attempts via the D channel. The use of the D-channel filter is particularly useful if qualified attacks are to be expected via remote access (for example, in the case of remote maintenance and administration).

D-channel filters continue to restrict features and services for the numbers of certain communication partners in such a way that they can not be misused or endanger the ISDN terminal under specific operating conditions. Attempts to use unauthorized features and services are answered and logged by D-channel filters with a disconnect, release.

Further information on this technology initiated by the BSI can be obtained from the IT-Grundschutz hotline.
