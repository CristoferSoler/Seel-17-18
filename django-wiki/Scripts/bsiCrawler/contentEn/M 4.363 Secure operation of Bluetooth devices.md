#M 4.363 Secure operation of Bluetooth devices
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

Bluetooth devices must be secured appropriately. The following describes which measures should be taken.



## Examples 
* The pairing of two devices should always be carried out in a secure environment. An environment can be considered secure if there is no way to get in from the outside without being monitored. The range of your own Bluetooth devices alone is not critical.
* Solutions with semi-permanent connection keys are to be preferred.
* The mating should only be done with trusted devices.
