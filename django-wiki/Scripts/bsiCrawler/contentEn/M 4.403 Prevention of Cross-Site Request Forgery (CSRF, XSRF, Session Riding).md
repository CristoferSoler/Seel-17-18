#M 4.403 Prevention of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF, XSRF, Session Riding)
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, responsible for the individual applications

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Administrator

In a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, an attacker submits a command to a user for a web application (e.g., in the form of a link in a guest book). If the user follows this link, the command is sent to the web application and executed in the context of that user. If the user is logged on to the web application, the user's trust relationship to the web application is exploited and the command is executed with the user's rights.

To make such attacks more difficult, the web application should support security mechanisms that allow users to distinguish intentional page views from unintentionally redirected third-party commands. The following security measures are designed to prevent critical actions from CSRF attacks being inadvertently executed.



## Examples 
* In addition to the session ID, is a secret token used to access the protected resources and features of the web application?
* In web applications, is the referrer field in the HTTP request checked as an additional feature for a user to recognize an intended call?
* Are web applications running critical actions only after re-authentication or manual interaction?
