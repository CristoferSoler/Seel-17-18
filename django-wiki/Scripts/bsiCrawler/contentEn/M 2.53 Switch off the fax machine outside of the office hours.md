#M 2.53 Switch off the fax machine outside of the office hours
Responsible for initiation: fire protection officer, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: fax officer

In order to reduce the risk of fire from fax machines, devices that are not required outside working hours (department fax machine, personal device) should be switched off at the end of work , This can also ensure that incoming fax transmissions do not remain uncontrolled in the fax machine for a longer time. The shutdown can be implemented in a simple way by means of timers, which limit the power supply of the device to the usual B rozeiten.

For later incoming broadcasts another (as constantly as possible controlled) fax connection can be named or in modern PBXs call forwarding be set up.

At the same time, with the switching off of the fax machine, the overloading of the device due to a technical failure or due to intentional mass fax transmissions outside the B rozeit can be prevented.

The switch-off should be avoided if there are special requirements for the availability of the device that can not be met by the alternative solutions.
