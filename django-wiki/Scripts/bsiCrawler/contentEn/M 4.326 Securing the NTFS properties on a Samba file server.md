#M 4.326 Securing the NTFS properties on a Samba file server
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Windows file systems are sometimes very different from Unix file systems. When file system objects are copied or moved across system boundaries (for example, from a Windows XP system to a file share on a Samba server), information may be lost if administrators are unaware of such effects and Samba is misconfigured. Specifically, this involves information that can be stored in New Technology File System (NTFS) Access Control Lists (ACLs) or NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS).



## Examples 
* supports the file system of the Samba share POSIX ACLs,
* Samba was compiled with ACL support (parameter -with-acl-support of configure script) and
* the configuration parameter nt acl support in the configuration file smb.conf was not set to no.
