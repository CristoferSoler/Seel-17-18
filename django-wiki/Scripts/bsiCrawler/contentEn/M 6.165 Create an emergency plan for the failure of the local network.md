#M 6.165 Create an emergency plan for the failure of the local network
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The partial or complete failure of the local area network usually has serious implications for the IT environment, as users can no longer access the functionality provided by the network. For example, you will not be able to access your e-mail or file server, print, or even stop phoning.

In the context of emergency preparedness, a concept should therefore be drafted on how the consequences of a failure can be minimized and what activities should be carried out in the event of a failure.

The following aspects must be considered:



## Examples 
* Has the emergency planning for the local network been integrated into the existing emergency plan and coordinated with further emergency planning?
* Is the documentation up-to-date and is it updated in the case of significant changes Is the documentation protected against unauthorized access, but available to the responsible parties in an emergency at any time?
* Have regulations been created for the LAN as part of the general data protection concept?
* Will the most important configuration files be saved in electronic form?
* Is trained personnel available in an emergency?
* Does a recovery plan exist?
* Are emergency exercises for emergency preparedness for the failure of a LAN carried out?
