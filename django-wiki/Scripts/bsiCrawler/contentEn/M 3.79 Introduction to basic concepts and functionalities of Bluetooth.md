Bluetooth is a wireless technology that is used primarily at close range. These measures provide an overview of the technical basics for data transmission used, as well as explanations of terms and functionalities that are necessary for the use of Bluetooth.



## Examples 
* The first method is a binary frequency modulation called Basic Rate, where one bit per symbol is transmitted. This achieves a data rate of 1 MBit / s. This method has been part of the Bluetooth specification since version 1.1. All Bluetooth solutions must support this procedure.
* The second method is a quadrature phase modulation in which two bits per symbol are transmitted. This method achieves a data rate of 2 Mbit / s, which is called Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). The procedure is defined in the Bluetooth version 2.0 + EDR.
* The third method is an eight-valued phase modulation, in which three bits per symbol are transmitted. The data rate, which is also called Enhanced Data Rate, reaches 3 Mbit / s. This procedure is also defined in the Bluetooth version 2.0 + EDR.
