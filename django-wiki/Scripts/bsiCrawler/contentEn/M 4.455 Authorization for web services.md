Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, responsible for the individual applications, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer



## Examples 
* Has a suitable role and rights model been developed?
* Are the access rights checked every time you access each resource?
* Does a SOA have a central tool for managing roles and rights?
* Is the principle of minimum authorizations consistently enforced, in particular for administrative access and the service accounts of the software involved?
* Is a secure architecture used for publicly accessible web services, for example in the form of a DMZ with security service or XML security gateway?
* If the authorization fails, does the system return to a safe state according to the need for protection?
