#G 5.25 masque
The masquerade uses an attacker to fake a false identity. He obtains a false identity, for example. by identifying the user ID and password (see also G 5.9 Unauthorized use of IT), manipulating the sender field of a message or manipulating an address (see, for example, G 5.48 IP Spoofing or G 5.87 Web Access). Spoofing) in the network. Furthermore, a false identity can be obtained by manipulating the Calling Line Identification Presentation (ISDN) in the ISDN or by manipulating the sender ID of a fax sender (CSID Call SubscriberID).

A user who has been  concerned about the identity of his communication partner can easily be made to reveal sensitive information.

An attacker can also try to masquerade in an already existing connection without having to authenticate himself, since this step has already been carried out by the originating communication participants (see also G 5.89 Hijacking of Netz -Links).
