#M 2.406 Appropriate selection of directory services components
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT

In the planning and design phase for a directory service, its purpose and deployment scenarios have been defined and security policies established for deployment.

Once the requirements for using a directory service have been specified, suitable components must be identified for its implementation. This applies in particular to the software to be procured. But even the required hardware and operating system as well as the network infrastructure must meet the requirements.



## Examples 
* Active Directory on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server or Windows Server 2003 networks
* eDirectory, formerly NDS in Novell networks
* Fedora Directory Server, powered by Red Hat
* OpenLDAP (open source software for various operating systems)
* Apple Open Directory in Mac OS X Server
* IBM Tivoli Directory Server
* Sun Java System Directory Server
* Network Information Service (NIS) in Unix networks (not LDAP-based)
