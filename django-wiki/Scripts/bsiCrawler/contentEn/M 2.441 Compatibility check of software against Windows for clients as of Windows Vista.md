#M 2.441 Compatibility check of software against Windows for clients as of Windows Vista
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: administrator, IT security officer, IT manager

Windows client versions as of Windows Vista are characterized by new security mechanisms and operating system features compared to previous versions of Windows. Their requirements are not met by any software. As a result, software that was able to run successfully on previous versions of Windows Vista is not readily supported on newer versions of Windows such as Vista, 7, or 8. The most notable difference between Windows 7 and Windows 8 is the user interface and the associated operating concept, which has changed dramatically. Since Windows 8 has taken over significant parts of the code base of Windows Vista and Windows 7, most applications can continue to be used under Windows 8. However, a compatibility check must nevertheless be carried out for all versions as part of a procurement or migration.



## Examples 
* Check the compatibility of applications and hardware for Windows 7 and Windows 8 in the Windows Compatibility Center. For Windows 8, pay attention to the Windows 8 Compatible logo.
* The Windows Upgrade Assisstent is available for upgrades to both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, and examines existing PC hardware, installed desktop apps, and connected devices for compatibility with a later version of Windows. The Windows Upgrade Assisstent is available for download at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-assistant-download-online-faq
* Examination of the specification of the system requirements on the manufacturer side
* Legally binding assurance of compatibility by the manufacturer of the software
*  Checking compatibility in a test environment
* Request from Microsoft related to known compatibility issues or compatibility issues
* Exchange with other users
* Search related to known compatibility or compatibility issues
* Investigate the software with supportive diagnostic programs like regmon, filemon or, under Windows 7 and Windows 8, procmon
