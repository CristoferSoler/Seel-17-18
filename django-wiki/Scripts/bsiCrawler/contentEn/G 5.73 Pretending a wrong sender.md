#G 5.73 Pretending a wrong sender
It is relatively easy to specify a wrong sender when sending e-mails, as when forwarding SMTP-based e-mail, it is usually not checked where the message comes from, just where it should go. In addition, many e-mail clients allow you to enter any sender information. This may result in damage if the recipient regards the information contained therein as authentic and binding.



## Examples 
* Most of the countless spam e-mails that clog users' mailboxes every day carry a fake sender.
* Some of the various e-mail worms that have been mischievous on the Internet for several years use an address from the e-mail address book of the user whose e-mail program they have just entered as the sender address. For example, the next victim will receive the email containing the worm with a known sender address, so they are more likely to open the e-mail or even the infected attachment.
* With many common e-mail programs, it is possible without any problems to forward an e-mail with faked sender details to the e-mail server without password checking. The e-mail sent in this way may be marked as Unverified in the X-Transmitters field if the user authentication is not successful. However, experience has shown that this is barely noticeable to any recipient. In any case, these fields are not displayed by most e-mail programs in the standard configuration.
