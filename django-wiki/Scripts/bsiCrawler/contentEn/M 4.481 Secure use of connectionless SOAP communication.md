The protocol profileSOAP  overUDPisused primarily for multicast addressing. It also protects the resources of narrowband communication media. SOAP messages are sent to an anonymous multicast address, so a provider usually does not know who the recipients are.

In order to prevent messages from being sent to unauthorized recipients, the corresponding protection must be implemented in the SOAP messages themselves. The provider can achieve this through appropriate content encryption so that only authorized recipients can read the SOAP messages.
