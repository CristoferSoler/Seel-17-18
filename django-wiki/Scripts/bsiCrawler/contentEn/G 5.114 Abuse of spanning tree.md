#G 5.114 Abuse of spanning tree
The spanning tree protocol is specified in IEEE802.1d. Spanning Tree is used to avoid looping within a network with multiple switches. In this method, redundant network structures are determined and mapped into a cycle-free structure. This measure reduces the active connection paths of an arbitrarily meshed network structure to a tree structure.

The following figure shows that a port on the bottom switch has been blocked using spanning tree. By sending out Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs), a root bridge is determined, based on the set priority and MAC address of the switch. In the figure, the switch on the top right represents the root bridge.



Spanning Tree does not provide authentication when exchanging BPDUs. This can be exploited in switched networks by attackers. If an attacker from a station connected to the switch is able to send BPDUs, the topology is recalculated using the Spanning Tree algorithm. The convergence for calculating the topology change can be 30 seconds for the spanning tree. As a result, the availability of BPDUs can seriously affect the availability of the network.
