When a new version of the software is loaded onto an embedded system, it must be possible to completely restore the system to the state it was in before the change started. If this is not possible by means of native mechanisms, it must first be ensured that the previous functional software version is available and can be manually re-recorded in the event of a failed update. In the case of increased demands on availability, it should always be possible to restore the last functioning configuration and the delivery condition. For this purpose, the complete configuration state must be saved before each change. It is also a good idea to have fully configured fallback systems with the last working configuration. In the event of a fault, these could quickly replace the changed systems that no longer work correctly with the new version.
