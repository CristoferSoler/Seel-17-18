#M 4.28 Software reinstallation when changing the user of a laptop
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If the user of a laptop changes, it must be ensured that there is neither data requiring protection nor computer viruses. The deletion of data can be done by completely overwriting or by using special deletion programs. A current virus search program must then be used. Both processes must be carried out for all used data carriers such as hard disks, floppy disks, CDs or USB sticks.

However, it is recommended to reformat the hard disk of the portable PC and then re-install the required software and data. What needs to be taken into account here is described in M 4.235 Comparing the Datasets of Laptops.
