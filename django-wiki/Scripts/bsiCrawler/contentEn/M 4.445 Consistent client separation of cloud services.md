#M 4.445 Consistent client separation of cloud services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

A client separation must be set up so that a client (cloud user) can not unauthorizedly view information from other clients (cloud users). It must also be ensured that no client can access the resources of another client, for example, virtual machines, networks or cloud storage.



## Examples 
* Test and release process of cloud service profiles,
* Evaluation of the cloud administration log files,
* manual checking of configuration files on the cloud elements or
* Carry out penetration tests to validate client separation.
