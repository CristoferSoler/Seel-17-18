#G 5.35 Overloading by faxes
Overloading due to incoming fax transmissions can occur if there are not enough fax connections or not enough telecommunication lines or channels available. In addition, a fax connection can be deliberately blocked by:

* continuously extensive faxes (possibly with meaningless content) to be sent or
* deliberately faxes are sent until the paper supply of a fax machine and the buffer memory are used up.


A fax server can also be overloaded if faxes are sent until the space available on the hard disk is exhausted. It should be noted, however, that a faxed page DIN A 4 is about 70 kB in size. With today's hard disk sizes, many fax transmissions of this type have to be received. In addition, it must be taken into account that only a limited number of lines or channels is available and each fax transmission also takes time for the processing of the fax protocol. Overloading of the fax server in this sense can only occur if a hard disk dimensioned too small or faxes are archived on the fax server.

In contrast to conventional fax machines, the overloading of a fax server by outgoing fax transmissions is quite possible. Thus, a very large number of serial fax transmissions can fully utilize a fax server and thus also no longer receive incoming fax transmissions.
