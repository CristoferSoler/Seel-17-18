#G 0.22 Manipulation of information
Information can be manipulated in a variety of ways, eg. due to erroneous or incorrectly recorded data, changes in the content of database fields or correspondence. In principle, this not only concerns digital information, but also, for example, paper documents. However, a perpetrator can only manipulate the information he has access to. The more access rights a person has to files and directories of IT systems or the more accessibility of information they have, the more serious manipulations they can make. If the manipulations are not detected early enough, the smooth running of business processes and specialist tasks can be severely disrupted.

Archived documents usually represent valuable information. The manipulation of such documents is particularly serious, as it may not be noticed until years later and a check is then often no longer possible.

Tampering with information may, among other things, be done out of revenge, in order to vandalize damage, to gain personal gain or enrichment.



## Examples 
* One of her employees got annoyed about her boyfriend's bookkeeping in the bookkeeping department, as she gained access to her computer without permission during a short absence of her colleague. Here it has made enormous changes to the published annual results of the company through a few changes in the monthly balance sheet.
