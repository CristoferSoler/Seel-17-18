#G 5.33 Pretending a wrong sender for faxes
Just as one can write a letter under the wrong name and with the wrong letterhead, one can also send a corresponding fax. This may result in damage if the recipient regards the information contained therein as authentic and possibly legally binding (see G 3.14 misjudgment of the legal liability of a fax).



## Examples 
* Signatures can be scanned from other documents and printed on the fax template, or copied into the document as a graphics file when using a fax server. On the received fax, no difference can be seen between such a reproduced and an authentic handwritten signature.
* During transmission, the telephone number of the sending fax connection is usually transmitted. However, it is possible to show another phone number. Therefore, the evaluation of the reception protocol is not a reliable confirmation of the sender.
