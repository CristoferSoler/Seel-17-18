#M 3.52 Training on SAP systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, users, supervisors

An SAP system is complex both in administration and operation as well as in use. All persons who work with an SAP system must therefore be trained compulsorily. This is especially true for administrators.



## Examples 
* Are all people who work with the SAP system sufficiently trained to handle SAP safely?
* Are SAP administrators regularly informed about security-relevant topics in dealing with SAP systems?
