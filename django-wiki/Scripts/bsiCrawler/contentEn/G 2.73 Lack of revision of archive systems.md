#G 2.73 Lack of revision of archive systems
The revision of an archiving process must take into account both organizational and technical criteria. The examination of archive systems must therefore include the assessment of the assignment and use of access rights, in addition to the assessment of the system configuration.

If the selected archive system does not provide the necessary technical support, eg. In the form of special user accounts for the revision, monitoring tools, integrity-protected log files (see G 2.76 Insufficient documentation of archive accesses), the test procedure can be very time-consuming. As a result, there is a risk that this will only be incomplete and significant points will be overlooked. The revision process of the archiving process can be endangered as a result.

Indirectly, this can result in legal and economic disadvantages, eg. By eliminating the evidence of archived documents.
