#M 2.405 Creation of a security policy for the use of directory services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

As one of the next organizational tasks in the planning of the directory service deployment, a security policy for the use of directory services must be established based on the security concept (see M 2.404 Development of a security concept for directory services). The security policy defines which specific security provisions are to apply in a directory service system and how these must be implemented during installation and operation.

The directory service security policy should govern all security-related topics of a directory service. This component-specific listing of subject areas can be brought into the following temporal sequence:



## Examples 
* the administration of the directory service tree or individual partitions,
* the management of the schema definition,
* the administration of the certification authority and the key objects,
* the evaluation of the log files on the individual servers or clients,
* the allocation of access rights and
* the deposit and change of passwords and the execution of data backups.
