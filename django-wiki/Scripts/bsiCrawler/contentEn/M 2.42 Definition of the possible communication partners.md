#M 2.42 Definition of the possible communication partners
Responsible for initiation: Data Protection Officer, IT Security Officer, IT Leader, Head of Organization

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

If information is to be transmitted to a communication partner outside of one's own institution, it must be ensured that the recipient has the necessary authorizations to process this information further. If information is exchanged between several communicating bodies, it should be clear to all those involved who has also received or will receive this information. In order to meet the above criteria, it is necessary to specify which communication partners may receive which information. For this it is necessary that all information is classified according to its strategic importance for the institution (see M 2.217 Careful classification and handling of information, applications and systems).

The recipients are to be informed that the transmitted data may only be used for the purpose for which they were transmitted. For reasons of data protection (see, for example, BDSG, transfer control), an overview should be drawn up as to which recipients are entitled to receive information, in particular personal data, by means of data transmission or data exchange.
