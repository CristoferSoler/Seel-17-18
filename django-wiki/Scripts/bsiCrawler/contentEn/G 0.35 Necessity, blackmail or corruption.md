#G 0.35 Necessity, blackmail or corruption
Mitigation, extortion or corruption can result in the security of information or business processes being compromised. For example, by threatening violence or other disadvantages, an attacker may attempt to bring the victim to disregard security policies or circumvent security measures (affirmation).

Instead of threatening, attackers can also deliberately offer money or other benefits to make employees or other persons a tool for security breaches (corruption). For example, there is a risk that a corrupt employee forwards confidential documents to unauthorized persons.

By means of subsidence or corruption, all fundamental information security can be fundamentally impaired. Attacks may, among other things, aim to divert confidential information to unauthorized persons, to manipulate business-critical information or to disrupt the smooth running of business processes.

There is a particular danger of such attacks being directed against high-ranking executives or persons in special trusts.
