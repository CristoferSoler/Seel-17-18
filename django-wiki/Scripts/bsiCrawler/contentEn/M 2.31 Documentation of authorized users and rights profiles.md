Allowed users:

* Assigned rights profile (if applicable, deviations from the standard rights profile used)

* Assignment of the user to an organizational unit, room and telephone number
* Time and reason of the device
* Expiration of the device


* associated users
* Time and reason of the device
* Expiration of the device


The documentation of the authorized users and rights profiles should be checked regularly (at least every 6 months) to see whether they reflect the actual status of the assignment of rights and whether the assignment of rights still complies with the security requirements and the current tasks of the users , The complete documentation is a prerequisite for checking the assigned user rights.

The documentation must be stored or stored so that it is protected against unauthorized access and so that it can be accessed even in the event of a major security incident or IT outage. If the documentation is in electronic form, it must be included in the data backup process.
