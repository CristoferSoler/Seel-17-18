#M 4.414 Overview of What's New for Active Directory on Windows Server 2008
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator



## Examples 
* Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS). In this application scenario, the Active Directory is used to publish certificates as part of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The certificate services already existed in earlier versions of Windows Server, but without the Active Directory suffix.
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). This service was introduced with Windows Server 2008 R2. He is responsible for the authentication of non-Active Directory users. A common use case is the authentication of web application users.
* Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), formerly known as Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM). This service provides an LDAP server as a data repository for directory services. Compared to the other scenarios, the administrative burden on domains and overall structures is eliminated. Each AD LDS instance maintains its own schema.
* Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS). The AD-RMS service provides protection of data and files via centrally controlled encryption.
