Initiation Initiation: IT Security Officer, IT Leader, Organization Leader

To delete information on data carriers, various methods are available. Which method should be chosen depends essentially on the protection requirements of the data to be deleted, but of course also on the type of data carrier.

For example, with analog media, information can be blackmailed, cut, or erased. With digital data carriers, data can be deleted or overwritten with deletion programs.

The electronic data erasure methods described below increase protection against restoring residual data in that order.



## Examples 
* created by the operating system or application program and deleted again intermediate files (cache files) or temporary files,
* automatically created backup copies of a program, such as those often created by Office programs,
* Paging files (see also M 4.325 Deleting Paging Files),
* Data fragments that may be present on Windows operating systems in the registry or in index databases,
* File slack (file slack or data offset refers to the storage of pop up data in unallocated areas of data carriers) or cluster tip fragments, which is common in some operating systems.
