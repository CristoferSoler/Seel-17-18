#M 4.261 Safe handling of critical SAP authorizations
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Authorizations that permit critical operations in terms of security or from a legal or business point of view are called critical by SAP. Affected are z. B. Operations that can lead to fraud or through which important data and configurations can be read or modified.

The allocation of critical SAP authorizations must generally be carried out with particular care. The handling of critical SAP authorizations must therefore be planned in advance. Organizational and technical measures as well as processes must then ensure that the desired level of safety is implemented. In the following, no list of critical SAP authorizations is deliberately specified, as this would always be incomplete and therefore imbalance administrators. In general, then refrained from testing the list and expand. However, the identification of critical SAP authorizations for the specific use of an SAP system is an important step that must be taken in any case.



## Examples 
* The profiles SAP_ALL, SAP_NEW * and S_DEVELOP * may not be used in a productive system.
* Administrative authorizations, profiles and roles may only be assigned to administrative users in accordance with authorization planning (see M 2.342 Planning SAP Authorizations). It is important to ensure adequate separation of the roles.
