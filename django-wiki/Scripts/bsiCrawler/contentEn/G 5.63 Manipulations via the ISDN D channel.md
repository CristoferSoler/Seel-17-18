#G 5.63 Manipulations via the ISDN D channel
The sum of all physical connections of the communication participants to a digital exchange assigned to them is called a connection network. Within the access network, there are numerous distribution points and transfer points, some of which are freely accessible and not expensive (eg, cable distributors). In the simplest case, the communication on the connection network can be interrupted by mechanical damage to a connecting cable.

Furthermore, with the aid of an ISDN protocol analyzer, it is possible to record and evaluate communication contents. By looping in a protocol analyzer it is also possible to manipulate control information in the D channel of the ISDN. The communication components of the attacked communication subscriber (ie ISDN cards, ISDN routers, telecommunications systems, etc.) can thus be triggered to reactions which impair their proper operation or lead to the compromising of stored data.
