#M 2.62 Software acceptance and approval procedure
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT

The use of IT for task management presupposes that machine data processing works as far as possible error-free, since the control of the individual results is in most cases no longer possible. In the course of a software acceptance procedure, it is therefore checked whether the considered software works error-free, that is, whether the software provides the required functionality reliably and whether, in addition, it is not undesirable Has side effects. With the subsequent release of the software by the competent authority, permission is granted to use the software. At the same time, this position assumes responsibility for the IT process that is implemented by the software.

For software acceptance, it makes sense to differentiate between software that was developed by itself or on assignment, and standard software that is adapted only for the specific application.



## Examples 
* the test cases are developed by the competent authority,
* for test cases, no data of the active operation is used,
* Test data, especially when created by copying the effect data, may not contain any confidential information; personal data must be anonymised or simulated,
* the performance of the tests must have no effect on the operation; if possible, a logically or physically isolated test computer should be used.
