#M 2.243 Development of the archiving concept
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: archive administrator, IT security officer

The structure of an archive system should be carefully designed. On the one hand, numerous influencing factors (eg organizational or legal requirements, technical and organizational environmental conditions) have to be taken into account, on the other hand there are many technical possibilities to build up an electronic archive. For this reason, a concept should initially be developed in which all factors and decision criteria for the choice of a specific archiving system and the corresponding products are taken into account and which at the same time is economically justifiable from a cost point of view.

The basis for the archiving concept is the objective stipulated in M .2.242 Objective of electronic archiving.

In the archiving concept, the technical or organizational use of the archive system has to be defined, eg z.

* the responsibilities and responsibilities,
* the definition of user roles (eg archive administrators, administrators, users, technical users),
* Definition of access rights and modalities for assigning rights,
* Delimitation of the data to be archived
* Protection of archived data, eg. By encryption and signing,
* the desired system connection or the operating conditions for archiving components,
* the technical design of the archive system,
* the operation of the archive system (eg description of service level agreements).


The results should be documented updateable and extensible in writing. The archiving concept itself should be kept in all translated versions. Employees are to be informed about the part of the concept that concerns them. The information should be verifiably documented. A possible structure of an archiving concept is shown as an example in the following table of contents:
