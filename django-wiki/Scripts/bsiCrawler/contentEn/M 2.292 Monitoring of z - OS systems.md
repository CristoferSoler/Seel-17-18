#M 2.292 Monitoring of z / OS systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to be able to detect and rectify error situations and security problems in a timely manner, it is necessary to monitor the ongoing operation of z / OS systems. For this purpose, various data sources of the operating system are available. These can be analyzed either manually by operating or automatically by programs.

The following recommendations should be considered when monitoring z / OS systems:



## Examples 
* Is the ongoing operation of z / OS systems monitored?
* Is the MPF function used on z / OS to filter out the important system messages from the messages in the ABAP console?
* On z / OS, are the SMF suites used to analyze security policies?
* When monitoring the z / OS systems, are log data from applications analyzed for security links and important messages made available to the operators?
* For installations with different locations: Is there a central location that reports all information important to the operation of the z / OS system?
