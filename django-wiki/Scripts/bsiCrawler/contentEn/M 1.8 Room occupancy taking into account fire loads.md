#M 1.8 Room occupancy taking into account fire loads
Responsible for initiation: fire protection officer, head of building services

Responsible for implementation: fire protection officer, building services

A fire load is created by all flammable substances that are introduced into the building. It depends on the quantity and calorific value of the substances. IT equipment and cables are as much a fire load as furniture, floor coverings and curtains. Further information on flammability or non-flammability of building materials (building material class A or B) can be found in DIN4102 part 1 and part 4.

When placing IT equipment, data carriers, etc., prior notice should be given to the existing fire loads in the same room and in the adjacent rooms. For example, the disk library should not be located near or over a paper store.

Even during operation, care must be taken to avoid unnecessary fire loads. The regular disposal of waste, especially waste paper and packaging waste, is active fire protection.
