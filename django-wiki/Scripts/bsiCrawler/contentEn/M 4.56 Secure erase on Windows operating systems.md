#M 4.56 Secure erase on Windows operating systems
Responsible for Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user



## Examples 
* Is it ensured that Windows is installed as the only operating system on the local hard drives or is using a hard disk encryption program when using another operating system?
* Are all users aware that files deleted from the Recycle Bin have not been reliably deleted?
* Are additional irretrievable erasure programs used, in particular for sensitive data?
