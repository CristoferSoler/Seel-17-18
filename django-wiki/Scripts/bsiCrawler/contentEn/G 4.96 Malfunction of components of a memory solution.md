#G 4.96 Malfunction of components of a memory solution
The malfunction of components of a storage solution can have far-reaching consequences for an institution. After a malfunction has occurred, important applications may no longer work properly, threatening data loss and financial risks. This also applies to the malfunction of the communication between the so-called cloud orchestrator and the storage element manager when using storage solutions for cloud services.

Causes for such malfunctions can be of a different nature. A common reason is that incompatible system components are used. Many manufacturers assume that institutions stick to the manufacturer's compatibility matrix when building and operating complex IT infrastructures. Failure to do so may result in malfunction or performance degradation.

For example, if an institution experiences performance losses due to a lack of Quality of Service (QoS) when accessing needed storage resources, this should also be considered a component malfunction.

A particular manifestation of the malfunction of components is described in G4.95 Failure of Components of a Memory Solution.
