#M 1.41 Protection against electromagnetic radiation
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: procurer, building services

If information technology devices are accommodated in a protective cabinet, electromagnetic radiation can be generated by adjacent devices which impairs the function of the devices (especially in industrial production areas). By retrofitting filters and door seals, the radiation inside the protective cabinet can be reduced. At the same time, these measures also prevent the spread of compromising radiation of the devices in the cabinet.
