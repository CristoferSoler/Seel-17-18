#M 4.222 Defining appropriate security proxy settings
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

This action will compile recommendations on default settings for key security proxies. However, the proposed settings may limit the functionality of the content in question (eg web pages may not be serviced due to the missing JavaScript) and therefore have to meet their own needs be adjusted.



## Examples 
* Blocking of HTTPS traffic if no HTTPS proxy is used,
* Complete blocking of cookies (possibly activation of individual websites),
* Filter or replace the browser ID,
* Filtering the following information from the Request HTTP header: Referer (if you leave a domain while browsing) ViaFrom
* Filter the following information from the Response HTTP header: Server
* In principle, release of all URLs. Possibly. Blocking individual, questionable URLs and
* Restriction to necessary MIME types.Note: The whitelist strategy Lock all that is not explicitly allowed can only be applied poorly to the blocking or release of MIME types. Due to the multitude of MIME types used by web pages, it is very difficult to lock the relevant types while at the same time maintaining the functionality of the WWW service at least somewhat. A pragmatic approach is the blocking of particularly questionable MIME types. To get a high level of protection, however, such a blacklist has to be constantly kept up to date by the administrator.
