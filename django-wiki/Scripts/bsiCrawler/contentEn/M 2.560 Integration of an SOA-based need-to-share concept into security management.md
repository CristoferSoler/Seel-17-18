#M 2.560 Integration of an SOA-based need-to-share concept into security management
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT, Head of Organization

If an institution introduces a need-to-share principle based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA), a safety culture must be established, which is characterized by a high level of security awareness for the new technology or thinking. The need-to-share principle requires that in principle more information be made available to all participants in a communication.

Employees must be aware of their responsibilities and have sufficient knowledge of the potential risks, for example, unauthorized outflow of information. For this purpose, a suitable safety awareness must be generated and conveyed.

The same applies if an existing need-to-know principle as a need-to-share principle is extended to all participants in an information domain. Everyone involved must also be aware of their safety awareness so that they behave properly and avoid risks. In addition, the need-to-share principle should not be extended directly to all need-to-know documents.
