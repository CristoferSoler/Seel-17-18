#M 6.59 Definition of responsibilities for security incidents
Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

Appropriate organizational structures must be in place to deal adequately with security incidents. Depending on the type of institution, but also the security incident, other groups of people may have to take action. In order to identify the right actors, it is advisable to go through the timing of an imaginary security incident and to consider who is needed in the different phases of a security incident. For the acting groups it is necessary to define which tasks and competences they have and in which way they are obliged or instructed. By way of example, this should be described for some of the typically affected groups.
