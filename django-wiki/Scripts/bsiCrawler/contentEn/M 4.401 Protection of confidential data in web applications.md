Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, responsible for the individual applications

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Administrator

In web applications, data is stored both on the server (for example, in a web application) and on the clients (for example, in the browser) and transmitted over networks. This may be confidential bank information, such as credit card information or bank transfers. Therefore, measures must be taken to prevent unauthorized viewing or manipulation of this data.



## Examples 
* Access data (eg user, password),
* Authentication data (eg SessionID),
* critical data processed by the web application (eg payment information or health data).
