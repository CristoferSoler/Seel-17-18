#M 4.494 Safe use of a development environment
Responsible for initiation: Head of Development

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Head of Development

The security requirements for the software to be developed result in security requirements for the development environment with regard to integrity, confidentiality and availability. These and the required safety measures must be documented. The following aspects should be considered.



## Examples 
* Is the development environment running separately from the production environment?
* Are comments and other irrelevant information removed before program packages are used in the production system?
* Do Distributed Workplaces Communicate Over a Secure Connection?
* Is an access control available for the development status?
* Is current anti-virus software used?
