#M 2.97 Correct handling of code keys
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: users

If protective cabinets with mechanical or electronic code locks are used, the code for these locks must be changed:

* after procurement,
* when changing the user,
* after opening in the absence of the user,
* if there is any suspicion that the code has been made known to an unauthorized person and
* at least once every twelve months.


The code must not consist of easily determinable numbers (eg personal data, arithmetic series).

The valid codes of code keys are to be recorded and stored in a secure manner (see M 2.22 Storing the password in an analogue application). It should be noted that a deposit in the associated protective cabinet is meaningless.

If the protective cabinet has another lock next to a code lock, it must be considered whether code and key are stored together, which would allow faster access in case of an emergency, or be stored separately, so that it can be used for one Attacker is more difficult to gain access.
