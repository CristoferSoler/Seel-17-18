#M 2.128 Access control of a database
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The database software must have appropriate mechanisms for identifying and authenticating users to ensure effective access control. The allocation of access authorizations must be carried out according to established rules (see M 2.132 Regulation for the setting up of database users / user groups).

In general, access to a production database should be prevented for normal users via an interactive SQL interpreter. Such databases should only have indirect access to the relevant applications. The only exceptions are database IDs for administration purposes.

Remote access to databases should be handled extremely restrictively. If this type of access is not mandatory, it must be prevented. Otherwise, only those users should be allowed a remote access, which actually needs them. Other users may not be able to gain remote access to themselves. Under no circumstances may remote access without specification of a valid user ID and entry of a password be possible.

In the case of increased security requirements, it should be checked whether strong authentication, which goes beyond user name and password, is required. Here, for example, the use of smart cards or so-called tokens comes into question.
