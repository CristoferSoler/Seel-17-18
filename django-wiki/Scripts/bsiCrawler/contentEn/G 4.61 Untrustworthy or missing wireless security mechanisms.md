#G 4.61 Untrustworthy or missing wireless security mechanisms
In the delivery state, the WLAN components are often configured so that no or only a few security mechanisms are activated. Some of the mechanisms are also unreliable and do not provide adequate protection. Even today, various WLAN components are in use or as new appliances on the market, the only insufficient security mechanisms such. WEP support. In some cases, these devices can not even be upgraded to stronger security mechanisms.

If no or only weak mechanisms can be used with which the radio interface or the services used via the WLAN can be adequately secured, secure communication in the WLAN is not possible. This results in further dangers for all components coupled with it, ie z. all data stored on a WLAN client or a LAN, which can affect the entire IT infrastructure of a government agency or a company. In the following, possible safety problems are listed as examples.
