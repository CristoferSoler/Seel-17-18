#M 2.107 Documentation of the ISDN card configuration
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Depending on the field of application, almost any complex configuration settings can be made for an ISDN card. To ensure an orderly restart (for example, after replacing an ISDN card or its communication software), it is recommended that you document at least the following settings:

* Type designation of the inserted card and serial number,
* Phone numbers) for the communication setup and any authentication to be performed,
* D-channel protocol used (1TR6, EDSS-1 etc.),
* B-channel protocol used (X.25, PPP, TCP / IP, bit-transparent etc.),
* Status of the used CAPI version,
* Status of the driver software used,
* Type of data compression when used
* Type of authentication (eg PAP / CHAP), if used.


When using authentication methods that are based on the possession of a shared secret (eg password), this secret can also be documented. However, it must be noted that the documentation produced may only be made accessible to a limited group of people in order to prevent the secrets becoming known.
