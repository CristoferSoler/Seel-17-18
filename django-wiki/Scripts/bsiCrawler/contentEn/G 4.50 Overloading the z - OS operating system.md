#G 4.50 Overloading the z / OS operating system
Even though the Workload Manager manages a z / OS operating system that should not overload, there are a number of threats that can lead to overloading. Overloading does not necessarily lead to a complete system standstill. Also, only different system resources may be unavailable, even though the system itself is still responding. The situations below are typical, but not the only ones of their kind.



## Examples 
* In a z / OS installation, too many initiators were started. As a result, too many batch jobs were activated simultaneously during batch processing, placing a heavy burden on the system's CPU. Although the system has overcome the load, the situation has led to long response times in the Time Sharing Option (TSO).
