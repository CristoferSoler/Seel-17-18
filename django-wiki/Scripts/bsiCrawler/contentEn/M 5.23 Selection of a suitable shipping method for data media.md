#M 5.23 Selection of a suitable shipping method for data media
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: users

In addition to the implementation notes outlined in M 2.3 Data Carrier Management, the shipping method of the data carriers should be based on the hazard potential. In terms of availability, the shipping method should be selected in such a way that a timely delivery can be guaranteed. The more people are involved in the promotion and the longer the times when the data carrier is left unattended, the less generally the confidentiality and integrity can be guaranteed. Accordingly, appropriate shipping methods are to be selected.

You can z. B. choose between the following shipping methods:

* Post (with different shipping offers, which include different guarantees for transport speed and protection),
* Courier services,
* personal courier and
* personal transfer.


It is advisable for a public authority or a company to keep a list of appropriate shipping methods proposed for different types of data carriers and their protection needs. This not only makes it easier for employees to choose from the best possible price-performance ratio, but also for optimum safety. This list should cover at least the following aspects:

* Average transport time of the shipping method or courier
* Reliability of the shipping method or the courier
* Costs.
