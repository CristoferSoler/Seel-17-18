#G 4.46 Incorrect synchronization of index data during archiving
During archiving very large volumes of data are stored. All archived data must be able to be controlled and uniquely accessed at a later time in a reasonable time at all times. This functionality is ensured by the archive system, which generates an index of the stored files for this purpose.

However, archive systems usually realize only simple file accesses. To achieve greater convenience in access, therefore, a parent document management system (DMS) is very often used to control the access to the archive and further functionalities, such. B. complex searches, be realized.

During archiving, the DMS generates the data referencing, checks its version and, if necessary, creates a full-text index, so that all data archived on the storage medium can be uniquely identified at a later date.

Ultimately, there are therefore two index databases (in the archive system and in the DMS), both of which must be synchronized. If unilateral changes in the index data stored in the DMS or errors on the storage medium occur without the changes in the other part being taken into account, archived data can no longer be assigned to the references in the DMS.

Status: as of 2005
