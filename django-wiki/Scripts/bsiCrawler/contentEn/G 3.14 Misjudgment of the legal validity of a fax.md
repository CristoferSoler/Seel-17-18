#G 3.14 Misjudgment of the legal validity of a fax
It is often attempted to save the postal service in urgent decisions by sending important documents or information to the business partner by fax. It is often ignored that documents submitted in a dispute are not always considered legally binding. Orders do not have to be accepted by the customer, promises are not kept. An appeal period may expire despite timely sending a fax.

As of July 1999
