#G 2.49 Lack of or insufficient training of teleworkers
Teleworkers are mostly on their own at work. This means that they have to be more familiar with the IT used than their colleagues in the institution, who can usually rely on local IT systems specialists at short notice. If the teleworker is not adequately trained in the handling of IT, this can lead to increased downtime in the event of problems, since an IT supervisor from the institution may need to drive to the home office of the teleworker to solve the problems there remove.
