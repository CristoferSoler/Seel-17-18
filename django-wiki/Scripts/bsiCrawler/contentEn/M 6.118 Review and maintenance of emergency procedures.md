Responsible for Initiation: Emergency Representative

Responsible for implementation: Emergency Representative

Emergency management is not just about achieving the desired level of protection, but also ensuring that it is permanently secured and continuously improving. Therefore, all emergency procedures should be checked regularly. A distinction needs to be made between checking that certain measures are appropriate and efficient in achieving the objectives set (checking completeness or updating), and controlling the extent to which emergency measures are taken in each case Areas have been implemented (revision).



## Examples 
* new business processes, applications or components have been built,
* major changes have been made to the infrastructure (eg relocation),
* major organizational changes are pending (eg outsourcing),
* the risk situation has changed significantly,
* serious weaknesses or damage cases became known.
