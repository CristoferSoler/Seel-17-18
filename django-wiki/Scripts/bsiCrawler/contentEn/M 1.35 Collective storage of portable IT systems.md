#M 1.35 Collective storage of portable IT systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If a large number of portable IT systems are in (mobile) use in a public agency or a company and the users often change, it may be appropriate to keep the temporarily unused laptops in a collective storage (pool). The space used should correspond to the requirements described in module B 2.6 Technical infrastructure space.

In addition, ensure the power supply of the laptops, so that the batteries of these devices allow immediate use. In addition, the withdrawal and output of portable IT systems must be documented.
