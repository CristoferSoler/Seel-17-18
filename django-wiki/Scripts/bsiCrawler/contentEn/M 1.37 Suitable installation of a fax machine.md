#M 1.37 Suitable installation of a fax machine
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Head of Domestic Engineering

Responsible for implementation: user, fax manager, building services

A fax machine should be installed in an area that is not accessible to the public. It is useful to check the access to this area or the use of the fax machine.

This can usefully be achieved by setting it up in a permanently occupied room (eg office, secretariat, post office). Outside of office hours or in the absence of authorized users, the device should be included (room or cabinet). It is important in this context that it must be prevented that incoming faxes can be viewed or withdrawn by unauthorized persons (see M 2.48 Defining authorized fax operators).
