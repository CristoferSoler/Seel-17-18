#G 3.30 Unauthorized private use of the official teleworking computer
In the home area, it is easier to use the official telework computer privately, because controls by the employer are only possible to a limited extent. There is a risk that unchecked and released software will be used and by careless action computer viruses and other malicious software reach the teleworking computer. This could compromise confidential data, for example. This improper use of the teleworking computer can not only be done by the teleworker himself, but also by relatives or visitors. In particular, children and adolescents may be tempted to use the teleworking computer for play purposes, in some cases even without the teleworker being aware of it. Examples of possible damages include: deleted hard drives with total loss of data, reinstallation costs or re-recording work.

It is also possible to access the manifold resources of the LAN of the institution via the teleworkstation computer. If unauthorized persons use the teleworking computer, this could also misuse services offered in the LAN, such as fax gateway, Internet connection and so on. In addition, there is always the risk of data and program theft.
