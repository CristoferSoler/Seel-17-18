#M 3.73 Training the administrators of a DNS server
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

In order to be able to administrate a DNS server correctly and securely, a training of the responsible administrators is indispensable. Even small configuration errors can lead to safety-critical gaps. In particular, the careful planning of the use of a DNS server and the restriction of communication to legitimate participants requires solid expertise.

In addition to the aspects of the general operating system security, as described, for example, in the blocks B 3.102 server under Unix or B 3.108 Windows Server 2003, the following points are important:

* Installation of the DNS server
* Possibilities to integrate the DNS server in the boot process of the operating system
* Introduction to potential danger in order to create a basic understanding of the nature of attacks
* Development of a rights concept, both for the configuration rights by administrators and for the rights of the DNS server process
* Difference between Advertising and Resolving DNS Server
* Configuration options of the DNS server
* Mechanisms for securing inquiries
* Mechanisms to secure zone transfers
* Mechanisms for securing dynamic updates (if used)
* Uses and configuration of DNSSEC
* Mechanisms to ensure the availability of DNS servers
* Mechanisms for securing the zone information
* Is the necessary budget available for the training?
