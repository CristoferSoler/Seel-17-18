#G 3.79 Incorrect assignment of SAN resources
Operating systems respond differently to visible storage resources. Unless a clear and strong association of servers and storage resources is made, unauthorized access to storage resources, eg. by other servers that circumvent the protection concept at the level of the operating system or the application.

At this point, not only the intentional attack is considered, in which an attacker tries to exploit gaps in the configuration for his intentions. Also noteworthy is the peculiarity of some operating systems, to bind all accessible hard drives and integrate them into their own hardware configuration.

Windows servers in particular tend to consume all visible storage resources. In the case of a storage network, memory areas assigned to other systems may be deprived of them or data may be corrupted or destroyed.
