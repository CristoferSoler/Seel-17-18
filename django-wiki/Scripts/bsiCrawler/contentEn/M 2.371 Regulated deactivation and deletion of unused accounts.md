#M 2.371 Regulated deactivation and deletion of unused accounts
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Human Resources, IT Leader

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, specialist responsible

If a user account is to be deactivated or deleted, the documentation of the access authorizations must be used to check which authorizations the account has in the IT environment and which authentication processes are required.



## Examples 
* Are Windows systems regularly checked for unused administrative and user accounts?
* Are unused user accounts disabled immediately on Windows systems?
* On Windows systems, before deleting user accounts, check on which objects the permissions are set?
* Are there any methods for the retention or reuse of data after deletion of user accounts for Windows systems?
* Are administrative backup accounts available on Windows systems?
