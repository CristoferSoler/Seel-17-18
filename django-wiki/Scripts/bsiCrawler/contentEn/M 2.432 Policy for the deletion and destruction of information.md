#M 2.432 Policy for the deletion and destruction of information
Responsible for initiation: Data Protection Officer, IT Security Officer, IT Director

Responsible for implementation: employees

Information must be safely deleted if data carriers are discarded or statutory retention periods are exceeded. A well-regulated procedure helps to prevent the misuse of stored data. Information on data media must be erased prior to transfer or disposal so that a reconstruction of the information can be ruled out with high probability. Even after receiving a data carrier, it must be checked whether the information contained in it must be reliably erased if it has been processed according to its purpose or transferred to other data carriers, for example for archival purposes.



## Examples 
* Is there a policy for the deletion or destruction of data?
* Is compliance with the Directive for the erasure or destruction of data regularly reviewed?
* Is the policy up-to-date? Does it take into account all currently used types of data carriers?
