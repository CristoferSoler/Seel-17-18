#M 4.270 SAP logging
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to be able to monitor the system functions and the system security of an SAP system, events must be logged. An SAP system offers many options. It should be noted that the present measure deals with the logging in terms of monitoring the SAP base system from the point of view of IT security. Business audits are not the subject of the measure.

SAP documentation with detailed descriptions of the system monitoring functions can be found in M 2.346 Using the SAP documentation.

In general, the following must be observed for logging.



## Examples 
* All events of the class critical should be activated.
* All events of the severe class should be activated.
* For the events of the class uncritical, a decision must be made as to whether these should be logged. It should be remembered that these include events that generate a large number of protocol entries. If the Security Audit Log is full, no more entries will be logged.
