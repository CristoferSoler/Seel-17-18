#G 0.21 Manipulation of hardware or software
Manipulation is any form of targeted but secretive intervention designed to change target objects of all kinds unnoticed. Tampering with hardware or software may, among other things, be done out of revenge, in order to vandalize damage, for personal gain or enrichment. The focus can be on devices of all kinds, accessories, data carriers (eg DVDs, USB sticks), applications, databases or the like.

Manipulations of hardware and software do not always lead to immediate damage. However, if the information processed by it is compromised, it can result in all kinds of security implications (loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability). Manipulations can be all the more effective the later they are discovered, the more comprehensive the knowledge of the workers are and the more profound the effects on a work process are. The effects range from unauthorized access to valuable data to the destruction of data carriers or IT systems. Tampering can also result in significant downtime.



## Examples 
* In one Swiss financial company, one employee manipulated the application software for certain financial services. As a result, he was able to get illegally larger amounts of money.
* Through manipulation of cash dispensers, attackers have repeatedly succeeded in illegally reading the data stored on payment cards. This data was later misused in connection with PINs issued in order to withdraw money at the expense of cardholders.
