The management of identities and permissions becomes more and more expensive as the number of users increases. The more manual activities are required, the more errors and safety issues can arise.

Therefore, it is recommended that even smaller institutions set up and operate an identity and authorization management. The following describes generic Identity and Permissions Management processes that demonstrate how to accomplish the required tasks and requirements.

Identity and entitlement management consists of the following generic processes:



Derived from the security concept of an institution, the requirements related to identity and entitlement management in a policy should be described. The policy should at least include how identities, user IDs, and permissions are created, modified, deleted, and controlled.

Each institution must have a proper approach to dealing with identities and permissions. It is therefore recommended to set up the tasks from the generic processes of the following described measures for an efficient identity and authorization management in the institution.



## Examples 
* Manage Identity's profile,
* Manage authorization profiles
* Manage user IDs,
* Manage roles,
* Analysis of identities and permissions and
* Manage accounts.
