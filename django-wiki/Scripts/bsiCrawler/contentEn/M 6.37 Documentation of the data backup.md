#M 6.37 Documentation of the data backup
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Responsible for data protection

In a data protection concept it has to be determined how the documentation of the data backup has to be done. Documentation is required for proper and effective backup. This is to be documented when creating the data backup for each IT system:

* the date of the backup,
* the amount of backup (which files / directories were backed up),
* the data carrier on which the data is stored during operation,
* the volume on which the data was backed up,
* the hardware and software used for data backup (with version number) and
* the parameters selected during data backup (type of backup, etc.).


In addition, it requires a description of the procedure for restoring a data backup. Here, too, a description of the required hardware and software, the required parameters and the procedure according to which the data reconstruction has to take place must be created.
