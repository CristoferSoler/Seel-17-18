#M 4.223 Integration of proxy servers in the security gateway
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator



## Examples 
* Restricting the communication links coming from the non-trusted network via a security proxy. This facilitates administration of the security gateway and reduces the likelihood of misconfiguration.
* Disguising the identity of the web server (several web servers used for load distribution appear under an IP address from the non-trusted network).
* Intercepting Web server error messages that could provide an attacker with hints about compromising the system (actually, this is a workaround because the web server should intercept this problem itself).
* Additional foreclosure of the web server, d. H. an attacker can u. You may be reading the information of a transaction, but you can not gain access to the web server.
* Disconnection of the IP stack of the server from the non-trusted network.
* Filtering unwanted requests from the non-trusted network to the web server.
* Increased availability due to load distribution and load reduction through caching.
