#G 4.41 Non-availability of the mobile network
Like all systems that do not guarantee 100% availability, mobile networks are not always available at the places and times when they are most needed.

The most common causes are radio tags, areas that are not supplied by their own network operator. If the demand is very high, parts of the network may also be overloaded. This may result in messages not being received or delayed being received or sent.

If data services are used over the mobile network, the transmission rates may be too low. There are different wireless network standards at the mobile operators with different data transmission rates (eg GPRS, HSDPA, LTE). So it may be that although the mobile network of the respective provider is available, but the fast data service over LTEoderHSDPAnicht works. Then information from the Internet is accessed only very slowly. Unlike telephony, where the difference between a GSM or UMTS connection is barely noticeable, the quality difference in data services is significant.

Furthermore, there may be interference transmitters which interfere with the radio operation in a spatially delimited area in such a way that mobile radio reception is not possible there. There are also devices that are sold exactly for this purpose. However, the operation of such devices in Germany is not permitted.

Defective electrical equipment can also interfere with radio communications.
