The z / OS Virtual Telecommunication Access Method (VTAM) component also provides the ability to protect login through a VTAM Session Management Exit (ISTEXCAA). This exit is addressed during session setup and detachment from VTAM and allows the following functions:

* Session Authorization Prompts and Allow / Deny Logical Unit Sessions
* Session AccountingCollect session accounting data for later evaluation
* Adjacent SSCP SelectionSelection of a system service control point according to defined rules (routing)
* Support of session takeover as part of XRF Application Processing


The VTAM Session Management Exit is often used for the first two functions, but only in a few special cases for the last two. The VTAM Session Management Exit must be created or procured by the operator. The manufacturer does not issue a VTAM Session Management Exit with the operating system.

The following recommendations should be observed when using the VTAM Session Management Exit.



## Examples 
* Writing a LOG entry (syslog)
* Writing an SMF record
* Interface to WTO (Write to Operator) for rejections
