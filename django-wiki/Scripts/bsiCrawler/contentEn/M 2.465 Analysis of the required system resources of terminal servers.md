#M 2.465 Analysis of the required system resources of terminal servers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to ensure the availability of terminal servers, the sizing of system resources is of crucial importance. Processor performance, storage system throughput, and size are features that describe the speed of a terminal server, but also greatly affect the stability of such a multi-user system.

In return, the performance of the terminal server clients is less important, as they themselves only take over the display and input management.

The more users use a single terminal server, the more processes are started on it and must be able to run promptly and in parallel. If certain limits are reached, the terminal server can impede the access of other users, react too slowly for the already registered users or even fail completely.



## Examples 
* The number of installable processors
* The addressability of main memory through the system architecture
* The manageability of memory by the operating system
* The speed of mass storage systems
* The bandwidth of the internal bus systems
