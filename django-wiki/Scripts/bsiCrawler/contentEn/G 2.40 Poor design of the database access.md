#G 2.40 Poor design of the database access
Users access one or more databases via a database management system (DBMS). This access happens directly or from an application. To ensure the integrity of a database, all database accesses must be controlled from one central location. Inadequate database access design can lead to the following security issues, among others:



## Examples 
* If the scope of the authorization is too restrictive for the user, this can lead to certain work not being carried out by the user.
* On the other hand, if the scope of the authorization is too extensive, this can lead to data being manipulated unauthorized or viewed.
* Allowing users to access the database directly (as opposed to accessing it from an application) generally entails the risk of loss of integrity of the database due to data manipulation, the impact of which users may not necessarily appreciate.
