#G 0.7 Major events in the environment
Major events of all kinds can lead to disabilities in the proper functioning of a public authority or a company. These include street festivals, concerts, sporting events, work fights or demonstrations. Riots associated with such events may cause additional consequences, such as employee harm or violence against the staff or the building.



## Examples 
* During the hot summer months, a demonstration took place near a data center. The situation escalated and there were violent acts. In a side street, there was a window in the data center area, through which a protester penetrated and took the opportunity to steal hardware with important data.
* When building a large fair, a power line was accidentally cut off. This led to a failure in a data center, which could be intercepted by the existing network backup system.
