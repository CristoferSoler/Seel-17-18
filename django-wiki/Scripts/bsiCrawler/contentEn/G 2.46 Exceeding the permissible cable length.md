#G 2.46 Exceeding the permissible cable length
Depending on the type of cable and the topology, the standards in question provide maximum cable lengths to guarantee the functionality of the network in accordance with these standards. Excessive cable lengths extend the signal propagation delays beyond the extent provided for the transmission method in question, so that the availability of the respective network segment or the communication bandwidth is reduced.

In addition to extending the signal propagation time, longer cables increase the attenuation. Exceeding the cable length in relation to the standard in question can make the attenuation of the cable so great that the different signal levels can no longer be distinguished from one another, as stipulated in the standard. Communication over the cores or fibers concerned can not be ensured in this case over the entire length.
