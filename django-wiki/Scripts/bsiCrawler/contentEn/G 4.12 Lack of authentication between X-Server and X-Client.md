#G 4.12 Lack of authentication between X-Server and X-Client
For the X-Window system, it is particularly true that without suitable security mechanisms, such as eg. Magic cookies or using Secure Shell, should only be used in a trusted environment. Without security features, all users involved have the opportunity to corrupt both the X-Client and the X-Server. The X server process, which is responsible for input and output on a machine, can not tell who the X client process is communicating with. All X clients can therefore access all data entered on an X server, and the X server has no way to determine from which X client it receives data. So z. B simulated. the program meltdown the optical melting of the screen of any X server. Similarly, it is possible to read data from an xterm client or send it its own data, so z. B. Screen dumps from another computer working with X-Window.



## Examples 
* The xspy tool automatically logs keystrokes on an Xterm remote.
* Windows that are displayed by an attacker on an X server are visually indistinguishable from those of the actually desired X client. In this way, an attacker can inject false information or provoke the entry of sensitive information with the help of faded windows.
