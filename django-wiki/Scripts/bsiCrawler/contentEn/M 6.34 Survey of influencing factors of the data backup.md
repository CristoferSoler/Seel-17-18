#M 6.34 Survey of influencing factors of the data backup
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, responsible for the individual applications

For each IT system, and possibly even for individual IT applications of particular importance, the following influencing factors must be determined. For this, the system administrators and the persons responsible for the individual IT applications can be interviewed. The results are comprehensible to document.

In the following, a fictional example will be used to show how the determination of influencing factors can be carried out in practice. The example assumes a server-supported LAN with 10 connected PCs as workstations. The IT system is used for order processing via a customer database. The application data is stored centrally on the network server.

In detail must be determined:



## Examples 
* Software: Network operating system, PC operating systems, word processing software, database software etc. in the form of standard software
* System data: On the network server: Internal settings (eg rights structure, passwords) on the PCs: Initialization files of the word processing software and the database software, macro definitions and text blocks
* Application data on the network server: files with correspondence, customer database
* Log data on the network server: Logging of network activities
