#G 4.36 Errors in encrypted data
If data exists in encrypted form and if it is changed, it may happen when deciphering the data that the data can no longer be decrypted correctly. Depending on the operating mode of the encryption routines, this may mean that only a few bytes are decrypted incorrectly or that all data from the error is decrypted incorrectly. If there is no data backup, this can mean a total loss of data.

The mentioned errors in the encrypted data can arise in different ways:

* When transferring the encrypted file, there is a transmission error that can not be resolved.
* On the storage medium (floppy disk, hard disk) there is an irreparable error.
* A computer virus performs data manipulation.
* A third party intentionally manipulates the data, for example by manipulating the encrypted data in a few places with an editor program.


In unfavorable cases, if z. B. If a bit loss occurs or large amounts of data are changed and error propagation occurs, the data can not be reconstructed even with knowledge of the cryptographic method and the key used for encryption.

Even more critical may be an error in the cryptographic keys used. Even the change of a single bit of a cryptographic key leads to the fact that all encrypted data can no longer be decrypted. Without a data backup of the cryptographic key, this data is lost.
