#G 2.14 Impairment of IT use due to unfavorable working conditions
A workplace that is not ergonomically designed or the working environment (eg disturbances caused by noise or dust) may result in the fact that the available equipment can not be used optimally or not optimally.

Most of the conceivable failures do not directly affect the IT. Rather, the users are influenced in such a way that they can not pursue their tasks with appropriate concentration. The disturbances range from noise or heavy, unorganized customer traffic to unfavorable lighting, poor ventilation and the like. As a first indication of such disturbances, the task completion can slow down and the number of small errors increase (draftsman, spelling errors). This not only affects the direct result of work. The stored data may also contain errors, the integrity of the data is reduced.
