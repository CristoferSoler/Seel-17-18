#M 2.517 Contract design with third-party service providers
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: Head of Procurement

The cloud service provider often works with software vendors or other cloud service providers to provide cloud services. In this case, security measures of the cloud service provider must be passed on to these service providers (see module B 1.11 Outsourcing).

Care should be taken to contractually regulate the following aspects.



## Examples 
* clearly defined interfaces,
* Commitments to virtualize the application (for example, a standard application in the cloud may need to be easily and automatically reproducible),
* Compatibility with specified version levels of interfaces, software or services.
