#M 2.531 Development of a security policy for web services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer

In order to ensure an adequate level of security for a web service, it is necessary to decide how the required security functions are actually implemented and who is responsible for them. In order to ensure auditability, such decisions must be documented comprehensibly. This documentation is best done in a security policy that is included in the security policy of the institution (see also M 2.338 Creation of target group-oriented security policies).

The security policy should include regulations on the following topics. If subject areas are already specified in other documents, a corresponding reference is sufficient.



## Examples 
* Involved systems
* Involved software components
* Use of directories (registries and repositories)
* Use of an Enterprise Service Bus
* Use of security components (XML firewalls, protocol servers and the like), integration of third-party security services
* Use of identity services and authentication or authorization services
