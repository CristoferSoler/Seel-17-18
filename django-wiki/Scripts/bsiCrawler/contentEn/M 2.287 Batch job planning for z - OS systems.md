#M 2.287 Batch job planning for z / OS systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

When using a z / OS system as a batch processing system, with a large number of batch jobs, it is essential that you plan, monitor, and edit the progress of these jobs. Since this activity can hardly be realized manually without errors, automation software, so-called job scheduler, should be used to control the batch jobs.



## Examples 
* Start the batch jobs
* Monitor the operational status of the batch jobs (also make sure resources are available)
* Checking the results (via return codes) of the batch jobs
* Track the dependencies of batch jobs
* Manage the status of batch jobs
* Corrective measures in case of error
