#G 0.6 Disasters in the environment
A public authority or a company can be damaged if there is a serious accident in the environment, for example a fire, an explosion, the release of toxic substances or the escape of dangerous radiation. There is a danger not only of the event itself, but also of the frequently resulting activities, such as closures or rescue measures.

The properties of an institution may be exposed to various environmental hazards, including traffic (roads, rail, air, water), neighboring businesses or residential areas.

Preventive or rescue measures can directly affect the properties. Such measures can also lead to employees not being able to reach their workplaces or personnel having to be evacuated. Due to the complexity of building technology and IT facilities, indirect problems can also arise.



## Examples 
* In a fire in a chemical plant in the immediate vicinity of a data center (about 1000mm as the crow flies), a powerful cloud of smoke was created. The data center had an air conditioning and ventilation system that had no outside air monitoring. Only by the attention of an employee (the accident happened during working hours), which followed the formation and spread, the outside air supply could be switched off manually in time.
