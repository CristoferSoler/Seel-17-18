#M 2.304 Security policies and regulations for the use of smartphones, tablets and PDAs
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

Once an institution has decided to use PDAs, they must be integrated into the overall security strategy.

When using PDAs, there are a variety of ways to protect against misuse. In order for these options to be used, a security policy should be drawn up describing all the security mechanisms to be implemented. Each institution should be aware of the opportunities and risks of using PDAs. Here, two safety aspects should be in the foreground:

* the security of data stored on PDAs and
* the impact of PDA use on the security of other IT systems within an institution.


Based on the PDA security guideline, users should be provided with a short and clear leaflet for the safe use of PDAs.



## Examples 
* which data can not be stored on a PDA,
* that data should not be entered or retrieved anywhere, as they may be read in,
* how, when and by whom data backups of the PDA are to be performed,
* under which technical conditions of use the PDAs may be used. These include, above all, the definition of security measures, the selection and installation of the required security hard- and software as well as specifications for the secure configuration of the affected IT systems.
