#M 4.397 Logging of security-related events of web applications and web services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer

Security-relevant events (for example, access to resources, authentication attempts) must be logged in a comprehensible manner, so that the log data can be used to detect causes in the event of a fault or error or after an attack attempt.

In addition to the recommendations in the measures M 5.9 Logging on the server and M 2.110 Data protection aspects during logging, the following points should also be taken into account when logging security-relevant events of Web applications and Web services.



## Examples 
* successful and unsuccessful login attempts to the web application or the web service,
* failed authorization attempts when accessing resources (for example, database accesses) and features of the web application or web service,
* failed validation of input and output data,
* fehlgeschlageneXML Schema validations,
* XML parser error,
* errors that have occurred (for example, exceptions),
*   changes to permissions for users or user groups of the web application or the web service (for example, access rights, changes to the web service policy),
* Changes to user accounts (for example password change),
* Deletion of the web application (for example posts),
* detected manipulation attempts and unexpected changes (for example, login attempts with invalid or expired session IDs),
* administrative function calls and changes to the configuration (for example, retrieval of user data, activation and deactivation of logging),
* Starting and stopping services,
* Production takeover (deployment) of new or existing web services.
