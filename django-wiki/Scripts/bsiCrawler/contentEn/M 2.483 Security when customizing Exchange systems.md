#M 2.483 Security when customizing Exchange systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

As part of customizing, a groupware system is configured and adapted to meet the specific needs of the institution. This task is usually time consuming. The following should be considered from a security point of view:

* For customizing, a corresponding concept must be created that describes the desired target state of the groupware system as accurately as possible. The concept also defines the processes by which customizing is performed. The concept has to be coordinated with information security management.
* The customizing may only be carried out by knowledgeable and trustworthy persons.
* Adjustments to the configuration of the groupware system should not be made directly in the production system, but in a test environment.
* As part of the customizing process, backflush processes are to be provided that allow adaptations of the concept during implementation (see also M 4.162 Secure Configuration of Exchange Servers)


The concrete implementation of the requirements from this measure can be seen, for example, for version 2010 in the Microsoft Technet. A custom installation of Exchange Server 2010 is described in Perform a Custom Exchange 2010 Installation: Exchange 2010 Help. Subsequent changes are covered in Modify or Remove Exchange 2010: Exchange 2010 Help.
