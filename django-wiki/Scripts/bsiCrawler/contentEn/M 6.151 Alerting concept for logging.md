#M 6.151 Alerting concept for logging
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: IT Security Officer, Head of IT, Head of Organization

In order to be able to react appropriately to security incidents occurring within an information network, an alerting concept must be created. An alerting concept includes a description of the reporting path, which informs the responsible persons when a security incident occurs, and a detailed description of the alerting process.



## Examples 
* After a security incident has been detected, an alarm can be issued on the Management Console in an IT early warning system.
* The events can be sent by e-mail to the responsible person. This is a very popular form of communication, but there is no guarantee that the reported incident will be dealt with immediately.
* Security-relevant incidents can also be sent as SMS messages to a mobile phone or a pager of the responsible administrator. It should be noted, however, that the message is too late or not transmitted because of possible Funkl cher.
* If SNMP messages are sent, an IT early warning system can be connected to a ticket system. As a result, the security-relevant incidents can be forwarded directly to such ticket systems.
* If open and well-documented programming interfaces are available, this offers a high level of flexibility when connecting to external processing systems.
