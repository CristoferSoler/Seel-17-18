#G 5.44 Abuse of remote access to the management functions of PBXs
PBXs have remote access for management functions. These administration and maintenance activities as well as other management functions, eg. B.Alarmsignalisierung and processing are handled.

Such remote accesses are useful and particularly indispensable, particularly in telecommunications systems (corporate networks). The type of remote access allows you to switch between

* IP-based access via data networks,
* Modem access via dedicated management ports and
* direct dial-in via DISA (Direct Inward System Access)


differ. Furthermore, in recent logging procedures such as QSig and some other proprietary protocols, management functions are already included in the signaling spectrum. This results in potential Abuse possibilities.

In the case of insufficiently secured remote maintenance access, it is conceivable that hackers gain access to the management programs of the TC system. If necessary, you can carry out all administrative activities after overcoming the system password. The resulting damage can range from complete plant failure, serious breakdowns, the loss of confidentiality of all data on the plant to major direct financial loss, for example. by fraud charges.
