#G 5.39 Intrusion into computer systems via communication cards
A communication card (eg an ISDN card or an internal modem, but also an external modem) can answer incoming calls automatically. Depending on the communication software used and its configuration, it is then possible for a caller to be able to access the connected IT system unnoticed.

A communication card can be used to connect an external computer as a terminal to a server. If the user logs off after a terminal session, but the line otherwise persists, access from the external computer is possible, such as via a local terminal. This gives third parties who have access to this machine the ability to test user IDs and passwords. Much more dangerous is the case that the connection is interrupted but the user is not automatically logged out of the remote system. Then the next caller can continue working under this user ID without having to log in. He thus has full access to the IT system without having identified and authenticated himself.
