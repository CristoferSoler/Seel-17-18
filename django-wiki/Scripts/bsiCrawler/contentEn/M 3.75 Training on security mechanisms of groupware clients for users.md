#M 3.75 Training on security mechanisms of groupware clients for users
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

Groupware systems are generally so complex that inadvertent vulnerabilities can occur if they are misused or configured. This is especially true if the users are not adequately trained in dealing with the groupware system used. Although the system configuration is usually set so that it can only be changed within limits by the user. However, ignorance of the security mechanisms and settings available to a user may cause the system to be used insecure.

Therefore, all users must be trained in handling the groupware client. In addition to the mere use of the client software, it is also necessary to explain to users the basic functionality of the groupware system. In particular, users must be taught which security mechanisms are available to them so that they are able to use them correctly and sensibly.

Employees must be informed about the risks associated with the use of groupware and e-mail clients. This could be. B. by a brief briefing or with the help of Merkbl geschehenttern happen. It should be noted that an unusual behavior of the communication software should be reported.

In particular, users must be taught which security mechanisms are available to them so that they are able to use them correctly and sensibly.
