#G 5.30 Unauthorized use of a fax machine or a fax server
Unauthorized access to a fax machine or unauthorized access to a fax server can be exploited for manipulative purposes. In addition to the costs for the fax transmission (fees and material), damage can also be caused by the fact that an unauthorized person pretends to use the device as the authorized person (letter with company head from the corresponding fax connection ).

It must also be avoided that unauthorized persons have access to incoming faxes.



## Examples 
* A fax machine is set up in the hallway, so that anyone can read or take faxes unchecked as they pass by.
* With a fax server, the permissions on the stored fax data are set incorrectly, so that unauthorized persons can read foreign faxes.
