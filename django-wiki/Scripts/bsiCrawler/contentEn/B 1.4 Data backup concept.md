#B 1.4 Data backup concept
## Description 
Due to technical failure, accidental deletion or manipulation, stored data may become unusable or lost. A data backup is to ensure that a redundant database of IT operations can be resumed at short notice, if parts of the operational data are lost.

The conception of an adequate and functional data backup, however, requires an orderly procedure due to the complexity. This module describes a way how to create a data protection concept for an IT system.



## Countermeasures 
In order to safeguard the considered information network, further modules must be implemented in addition to this module, according to the results of the modeling according to IT-Grundschutz.

To set up an effective backup, there are a number of steps to go through. These are described in measure M 6.33 Development of a data protection concept and are explained by the measures listed there. Therefore, implementation of measure M 6.33 should begin.

In the following, the package of measures for the area of ??data protection concept is presented, which makes sense above all for larger IT systems or IT systems with large data volumes. The processing of the measures should be done in the order given in order to systematically develop a data protection concept.
