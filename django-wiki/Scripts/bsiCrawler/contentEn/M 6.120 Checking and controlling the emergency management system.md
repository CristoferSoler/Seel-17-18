#M 6.120 Checking and controlling the emergency management system
Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, emergency officer

Responsible for implementation: Government / company management, emergency officer

The institution's management is responsible for the review, control and improvement of the emergency management system. An important basis for the decisions to be taken is clear and well-presented information on the current status of emergency management in the institution.

In order to manage and maintain the emergency management system, it is necessary to periodically review its effectiveness and efficiency, and to assess these results at the management level. The aim here is to coordinate the further procedure in the emergency management process. Therefore, all necessary changes and adjustments to the emergency management process, such as the objectives or requirements for emergency management, must be identified. The results must be documented and the previous records maintained.



## Examples
