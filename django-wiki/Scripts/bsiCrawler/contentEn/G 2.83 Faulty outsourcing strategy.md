#G 2.83 Faulty outsourcing strategy
The decision to carry out an outsourcing project is a far-reaching decision. As a result, a company or a public authority has a close relationship with the outsourcing service provider. Therefore, wrong decisions in this regard have long-term and serious consequences. These can have organizational, technical and even serious financial consequences.

Security issues (for example, lack of availability) at the outsourcing service provider can not only be expensive, but also life-threatening. However, misinterpretations of the outsourcing organization can have serious consequences. If, for example, the effort (eg preparation of documentation, tests, protection of systems) is underestimated, then delays are to be expected. In order to catch up on lost time and to save money, experience has shown that often the test effort is reduced, which can lead to compromising safety.
