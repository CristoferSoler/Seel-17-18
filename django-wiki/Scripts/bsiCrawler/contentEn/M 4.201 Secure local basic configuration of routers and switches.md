#M 4.201 Secure local basic configuration of routers and switches
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

All configuration work on routers and switches must be performed according to the security policy created (see M .2.279 Creating a Security Policy for Routers and Switches) and documented and commented on by routers and switches as described in M .2.281 System Configuration become.



## Examples 
* Local configuration: Checking and adjusting the configuration parameters related to the device itself (for example, user accounts or roles, passwords, log files, console access and serial port settings, etc.). The corresponding steps are described below.
* Network configuration: Checking and adjusting the configuration parameters related to the functioning of the equipment in the network (for example, services and protocols, setting up access control lists (ACLs), VLANs, etc.). The corresponding steps are described in M 4.202 Secure Network Basic Configuration of Routers and Switches.
