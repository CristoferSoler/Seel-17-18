#M 4.262 Configuration of additional SAP authorization checks
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

An SAP system makes it possible to change the preconfigured authorization checks (see also M 2.342 Planning for SAP Authorizations). Authorization checks can be disabled. There may also be additional authorization checks. In the context of the authorization planning this possibility is to be considered. In general, the following should be considered when making changes to the authorization checks:



## Examples 
* Access is always restricted to all objects in a group.
* The permission group is an additional check. The normal permission checks that the program or report performs are not affected.
* If authorization groups are used, planning can begin with a rough grouping, for example with regard to individual applications or modules. These can then be further refined according to the desired protection requirement.
* The precise operation and management of authorization groups must be known to planners and administrators.
