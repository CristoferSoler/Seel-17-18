In a comprehensive IT-Grundschutz training, the participants should practice examples using examples.

For the design of new IT-Grundschutz training courses, a slide set will be made available under the tools on the BSI websites for IT-Grundschutz. This can be used to build your own training on this. All course content is briefly described in overviews and structograms. It will be shown which contents should include a training, which should introduce into the procedure IT-Grundschutz and the application of the IT-Grundschutz catalogs.
