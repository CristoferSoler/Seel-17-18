#G 5.125 Data theft with mobile devices
Mobile devices such as notebooks, smartphones, tablets or PDAs are for the most part designed to enable easy data exchange with other IT systems. This can be done via a connection cable or wirelessly, z. B.Wireless, Bluetooth or a mobile connection.

Where open access to IT systems is possible, attackers can use mobile devices to inquire, modify, or take information away from their devices. A subsequent check or even a proof is not always possible, because often the accesses are not logged accordingly.

If the mobile device has a wireless communication interface (eg WLAN, SIM card or Bluetooth), the stored information can also be transmitted directly to any place in the world (see G 5.97 Unauthorized persons) Data transfer via mobile phones).

Example:

* An employee of a company is called from a meeting with an outside party to receive an important phone call. The outside person uses the short period of time without supervision to connect the PC in the meeting room to his mobile device. He then transfers all accessible data to his mobile device.
* A larger company operates its own wireless network (WLAN), which is not sufficiently secured. An attacker takes advantage of this and connects his tablet to the WLAN. He can now easily record all transmitted data and in the worst case has access to the files in the corporate network.
