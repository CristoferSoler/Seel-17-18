#M 6.144 Configure terminal server clients for dual use as normal client PCs
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If the central terminal server service fails, the precautionary installation of the applications that are used on the terminal server can temporarily maintain an emergency operation on the client PCs. This requires workstations that have sufficient resources and a stand-alone operating system that is capable of running the programs.

For this purpose, a selection menu can be set up, which allows the user during startup to differentiate between the execution of the system in client-server mode or in the terminal server configuration. On conventional client PCs (fat clients), which are able to execute self-sufficient applications during normal operation and only obtain certain applications from the terminal server, there is also the option of installing the software in parallel.

For the users, training should be carried out to demonstrate the correct use of these choices.

To use the terminal as a client PC, the block B 3.102 Server under Unix is ??also to be considered.
