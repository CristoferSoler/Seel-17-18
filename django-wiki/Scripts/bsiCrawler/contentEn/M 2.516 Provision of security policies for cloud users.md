#M 2.516 Provision of security policies for cloud users
Responsible for initiation: specialist responsible, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: specialist responsible

In cloud computing, both providers and users are responsible for the security of cloud computing platforms.

Cloud computing requires the cloud user to participate in the implementation of security measures. Depending on the service model (IaaS, PaaSoderSaaS, see the following intermediate headings), the scope of this cooperation may vary. Depending on the nature of the cloud service and the contractual arrangements, the cloud service provider should therefore alert the cloud user to this responsibility and provide him with security recommendations in the form of a policy.

The policy should include a description of the security measures implemented by the cloud service provider. This can strengthen the relationship of trust and increase the transparency of the cloud infrastructure for the cloud user.



## Examples 
* Name of the reporter
* Time of notification,
* affected cloud service,
* Expression of the event,
* Description of the effects, in particular which data and information are affected by the event,
* optional: Were vulnerabilities identified?
* optional: Notes from the cloud user for the correction
