#M 5.27 Telephone reinsurance via correct fax reception
Initiation Initiation: IT Security Officer, Supervisor

Responsible for implementation: users

For important fax transmissions, the recipient should be asked whether the fax transmission was completely received, printed out and handed over to him. The employees should be instructed. The telephone confirmation can also be requested on the fax form.

Helpful in this context are the individual end reports offered by some fax machines as a feature, which can indicate errors during shipping.
