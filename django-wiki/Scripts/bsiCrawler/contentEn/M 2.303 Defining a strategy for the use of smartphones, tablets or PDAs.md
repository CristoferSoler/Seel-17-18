#M 2.303 Defining a strategy for the use of smartphones, tablets or PDAs
Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

Before deploying PDAs in an organization, it is important to determine which general strategy the organization adopts with regard to the use of the devices. In particular, the following questions should be answered:

* For which applications should the PDAs be used?
* Are the employees provided with official PDAs?
* Is the use of private employee PDAs allowed or even officially supported?


In particular, the question for which purposes PDAs are to be used is important for the later decisions, because it can have a decisive influence on the selection of devices to be acquired and must in any case be taken into account when formulating the safety guidelines and Regulations for the use of PDAs are taken into account.



## Examples 
* Is there a general strategy for using PDA s?
* Is it determined which data can be stored on PDA s?
* Use of private PDAs: Is private PDA usage clearly regulated within the institution?
* Is it noted that prohibitions regarding private PDAs are to be monitored and consequences for non-compliance must follow?
