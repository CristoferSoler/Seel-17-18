#M 4.447 Ensuring the integrity of the SAN fabric
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In this measure, the integrity of the SAN fabric means that only the planned and operator-provided components in a SAN fabric are in operation, and that no careless employee or proactive attacker introduces components into the SAN fabric, thereby compromising SAN security. Fabric in operation interferes or allows data to drain. To ensure the integrity of the SAN fabric, protocols with additional security features should be used as described in this article.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has developed a standard describing various protocols to increase security in Fiber Channel networks.



## Examples 
* Diffie Hellman Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (DH-CHAP): DH-CHAP provides bidirectional, password-based authentication (CHAP) additionally secured by Diffie-Hellmann key exchange.
* Fiber Channel Authentication Protocol (FCAP): FCAP implements the mutual authentication of FC components based on digital certificates.
* Fiber Channel Password Authentication Protocol (FCPAP): FCPAP is a password-based method that leverages Secure Remote Password (SRP).
