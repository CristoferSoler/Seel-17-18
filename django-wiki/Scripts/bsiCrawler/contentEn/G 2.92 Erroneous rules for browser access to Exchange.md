#G 2.92 Erroneous rules for browser access to Exchange
Exchange offers the possibility to access your own e-mail account via a browser. This is done using Internet Information Services (IIS), which are an integral part of installing Exchange Server.

If this functionality is improperly planned and improperly controlled, this can allow uncontrolled access to the internal network from outside.

Misconfigurations primarily affect the authentication of the web client against the Exchange server as well as the protected transmission of the information over the network. If the required authentication methods are too weak, unauthorized persons may be able to access e-mail data and system resources. If the encryption mechanisms used are not sufficiently strong, data can be intercepted. In the case of insufficient authentication and encryption mechanisms, existing connections may be taken over by unauthorized third parties. Furthermore, viruses or other harmful code can reach the Exchange Server via this channel.

The danger potential is also manifold. Examples of further possible consequences are:

* E-mail addresses and content could be spelled out.
* Unauthorized persons could gain access to e-mail functions.
* Spam attacks could be enabled.
* Unauthorized persons can obtain internal information   about the company or the authorities.
* There could be direct attack on the internal network.
