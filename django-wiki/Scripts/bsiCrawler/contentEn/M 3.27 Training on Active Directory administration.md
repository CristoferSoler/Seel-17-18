#M 3.27 Training on Active Directory administration
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

The Active Directory is the central database of the server operating systems Windows Server 2000 and Windows 2003 Server (hereafter referred to as Windows Server), in which user data, group affiliations and other administrative data are stored. Clients can be managed in Active Directory from the Windows 2000 release.

For the administration of a Windows network detailed knowledge of the Active Directory and its basic concepts is required. Otherwise it can easily lead to misconfiguration, which can have significant safety implications. Training administrators in this area, and in particular on Active Directory security topics, is therefore essential.
