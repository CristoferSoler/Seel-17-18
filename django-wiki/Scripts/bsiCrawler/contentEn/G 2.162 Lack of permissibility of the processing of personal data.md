#G 2.162 Lack of permissibility of the processing of personal data
The processing of personal data is only permitted if a law or other law allows it or if the data subject has given his consent.

There is a risk that personal data will be processed unlawfully if there is no adequate legal basis (consent or legal permission, eg by data protection laws, social legislation, school laws, police laws, hospital laws). In addition, reference is also made to the threat G 2.105 of violations of legal regulations and contractual agreements.

Processing of personal data without a sufficient legal basis can result in a fine or imprisonment or lead to employment or employment law consequences. The person concerned may assert a right to compensation.
