#M 4.355 Authorization management for groupware systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The security of the business data processed in a groupware system is strongly determined by the set permissions for users and administrators. These determine which data can be viewed or changed. Therefore, the configured permissions and their management are a very important part of system security. The assigned authorizations, above all the privileged authorizations, must be regularly checked against the authorization concept and adapted promptly in case of task changes. The authorization concept must be appropriate to the protection requirements and include all groupware components operated.

The following recommendations should be considered when managing permissions. The list should be adapted and extended to local needs and requirements.



## Examples 
* A user administrator should be provided. This should be able to create, change and assign user IDs to roles. The creation or modification of roles or profiles may not be permitted by the system administrator.
* A profile administrator should be provided. This user can generate profiles for existing roles that do not contain privileged system privileges.
