#M 2.41 Commitment of employees to data backup
Responsible for initiation: administration / company management

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

Since data backup is an important security measure, the affected employees should be informed about the adherence to the data protection concept or the minimal data backup concept about their tasks when creating data backups. They should be committed to their careful implementation. This is especially important where centrally performed data backups do not work, ie. B. in non-networked or mobile terminals. A regular reminder and motivation for data backup should be made.
