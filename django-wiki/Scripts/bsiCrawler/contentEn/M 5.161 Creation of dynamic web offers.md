#M 5.161 Creation of dynamic web offers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to make dynamic web offers available, a program logic on the server side is necessary. In many cases this function can be taken over by the web server. Eg simple scripts or server side includes (SSI). With complex Web offers, however, a Web application server with a corresponding framework is frequently used. However, the web application server does not necessarily have to be disconnected from the web server because many common web servers already have a web application server built in (eg Apache Tomcat). The web application servers or the associated frameworks allow the realization of comprehensive web services. In addition, it significantly simplifies access to background or legacy systems. Commonly used programming languages ??and frameworks for dynamic web offerings are described in the following sections.
