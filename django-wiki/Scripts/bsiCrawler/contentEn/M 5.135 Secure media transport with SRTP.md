#M 5.135 Secure media transport with SRTP
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used for the transmission of media data of IP telephony and the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) for their control. Both protocols do not offer their own protection against the tampering and manipulation of IP telephone calls. Extensions of RTP / RTCP are SRTP / SRTCP, which provide protection mechanisms for the transmission. When using VoIP, it should be considered to protect the user data by using SRTP / SRTCP. The decision has to be documented.



## Examples 
* Are the reasons for or against the use of SRTP documented?
* When using SRTP: are the security-relevant options for implementing the protocol documented?
