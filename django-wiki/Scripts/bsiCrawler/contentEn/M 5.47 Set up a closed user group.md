#M 5.47 Set up a closed user group
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, TK-Anlagenverantwortlicher

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) allows you to set up a closed user group (GBG), also known as a Closed User Group (CUG). Feature of such a group is that all participants of a CUG can communicate with each other via the public ISDN, connection requests from outside the CUG to CUG participants, however, are rejected as well as connection requests from CUG participants to participants of the public ISDN.



## Examples 
* Hardware and software for other processes (eg M 5.48 authentication via CLIP / COLP) must first be procured,
* the members of a CUG rarely change and
* the network operator is sufficiently trustworthy.
