Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

As a rule, a fax server consists of the following components: The IT system itself, the operating system, the communication component (eg fax modem, active or passive ISDN card or dedicated fax card) and the actual fax server application. In addition, an appropriate fax client may be required for the workstations.

Before fax servers are procured, the main influencing factors for their use must first be ascertained. These are:

* The expected volume of faxes to be handled,
* the number of employees to use the fax server
* the requirements for the availability of the fax server,
* the requirements for integration into existing e-mail and workflow systems,
* the logging requirements on the fax server,
* Requirements for the type of forwarding of incoming faxes to the recipient.
