#M 4.2 screen lock
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: users

A screen lock is the ability to hide the information currently on the screen. A screen lock should only be activated by a successful user authentication, ie. For example, a password query can be deactivated in order to ensure access protection for the IT system in the event of a shorter absence of the IT user.

The screen lock should be manually activated by the user as well as automatically started after a specified inactivity period. All users should be aware that they will activate the screen lock when they leave work for a short time. For longer absences, users should log out.

The period after which a screen lock activates due to missing user input should not go below or below certain limits. The period should not be too tight, so that the screen lock does not start after a brief pause for thought. Under no circumstances may this period be too long so that the user's absence can not be exploited by third parties. A reasonable default is a period of 15 minutes. The IT security management team should set the latency requirements that take into account the security requirements of each IT system and its environment of use.

Most operating systems already contain screen locks. When using them care must be taken to activate the password prompt.
