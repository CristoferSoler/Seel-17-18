#M 5.67 Use of a timestamp service

The time information entered in the header of an e-mail can be manipulated relatively easily. If it is necessary to know the exact time of sending or receiving an e-mail, a time stamp service must be used. A timestamp is a time entry from a neutral entity that is no longer misleading. It is either fully automatic by a timestamp server, d.h. transparent to the user, or applied on request by the sender.

A timestamp consists of a timestamp certificate, which documents the current date and time as well as the identity of the timestamp service itself, as well as a digital signature via e-mail and certificate. The timestamp hereby documents and confirms the existence of a particular message with a specific content at a specific time. Ensuring the authenticity of the e-mail by the time stamp requires that the sender, in turn, digitally signed the e-mail.

A timestamp service can be offered and used both in an internal network and on the Internet. It accepts as a server in the Internet / Intranet signed files or even their signatures and provides them with a synchronized timestamp. Everything together is again signed by the time stamp service and optionally forwarded to the recipient or sent back to the sender.
