#G 2.179 Lack of manufacturer support in providing cloud services
It is rare for any cloud-based application, product, or platform to be owned or developed by the cloud service provider. Often there is a constellation that the cloud service provider also uses third-party service providers to provide the cloud services. In such cases, dependencies arise that can lead to cloud services being compromised.

For the cloud services, various scenarios of dangers arise, which mainly relate to a lack of manufacturer support (ie support from the third parties involved).
