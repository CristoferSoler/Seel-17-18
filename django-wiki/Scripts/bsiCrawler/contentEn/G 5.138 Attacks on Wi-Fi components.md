#G 5.138 Attacks on Wi-Fi components
Security problems with wireless communication, with individual WLAN clients, access points or the distribution system can lead to attacks being successful. In doing so, internal data can be read or changed. However, WLAN components can also be manipulated in such a way that they, in turn, can be used as an entry point for attacks on other networks and network components.



## Examples 
* With the help of spoofing, an attacker could install compromising tools on the client of a WLAN user.
* An attacker could check the client's network services and functionality for vulnerabilities and potentially exploit them. For example, this could allow access to the computer because passwords were selected improperly or the personal firewall was inadequately configured.
