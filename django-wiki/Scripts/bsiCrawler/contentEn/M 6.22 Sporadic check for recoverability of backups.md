#M 6.22 Sporadic check for recoverability of backups
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

For the reconstruction of a dataset, it has to be checked whether such a project can be carried out with the existing backup copies of the data. Due to technical defects, incorrect parameterization, a simple aging of the media, an inadequate data carrier management or the non-compliance with rules, which are required in a data protection concept, it is possible that a reconstruction of a data set is not possible. Therefore, it is necessary to check sporadically whether the generated backups can be used to recover lost data.
