There are many technical possibilities to make an attack: thrown bricks, explosion by explosives, firearms use, arson. Whether and to what extent an institution is exposed to the danger of an attack depends not only on the situation and the environment of the building, but also on its tasks and the political-social climate. Companies and authorities that operate in politically controversial areas are more vulnerable than others. Institutions near ordinary demonstration staging areas are more at risk than those in remote locations. To assess the threat or suspect threats from politically motivated attacks, the state police or the Federal Criminal Police Office can be called on to advise in Germany.
