#G 2.192 Insufficient availability of required human resources with sufficient qualifications
The smooth use of cloud services requires sufficient availability of qualified IT administrators. Lack of adequately trained and experienced administrators may, among other things, affect the institution's ability to provide service availability.

In the absence of planning, inadequate availability of human resources in practice often can not be remedied in the short term, since qualified or experienced personnel in Cloud Services administration are often difficult or even impossible to access.

Administrators who are already employed in the institution may not know what tasks they will be assigned in connection with the introduction of cloud services. In general, moving to cloud usage requires development from the system administrator to the service administrator. Such a change brings with it additional training needs, since untrained employees pose a considerable potential danger in the administration environment (see also G 2.103 Insufficient training of employees).
