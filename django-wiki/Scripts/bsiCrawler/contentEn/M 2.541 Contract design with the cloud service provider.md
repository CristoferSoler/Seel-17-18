#M 2.541 Contract design with the cloud service provider
Responsible for initiation: Public authorities / management, IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Public authority / management, IT security officer, IT manager

If the institution has selected a suitable cloud service provider, all relevant aspects of the planned cloud usage should be contractually recorded and regulated in so-called Service Level Agreements, or SLA for short. In doing so, the nature, scope and level of detail of the contractual arrangements should be adapted to the protection needs of the data and applications associated with cloud use.

Contracting with the cloud service provider involves a variety of different topics. It must be ensured that all previously defined requirements are also taken into account in the contract with the cloud service provider. In principle, the contractual arrangements should at least be based on the points described below.



## Examples 
* Regulations for the action of the cloud service provider when hiring IT administrators or other employees with access rights to customer data. For contractors with locations in several countries, it should be ensured that the same criteria are applied regardless of where the employee works (for example, with regard to education and training, required certificates, language skills).
