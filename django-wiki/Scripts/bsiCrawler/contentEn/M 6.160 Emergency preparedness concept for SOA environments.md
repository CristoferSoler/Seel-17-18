#M 6.160 Emergency preparedness concept for SOA environments
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

If, for example, a service provider fails in a service-oriented architecture (SOA), this can have serious consequences for the business processes of an institution. Then it's about resuming proper operation as soon as possible and taking appropriate safety measures. Taking account of cross-border emergency management (see B 1.3 Emergency Management and M 6.83 Emergency Preparedness for Outsourcing), a suitable emergency preparedness concept for SOA environments must be prepared. First of all, all possible risks should be analyzed, evaluated and documented together with the respective safety measures.

Since special conditions sometimes exist in SOA environments, these must also be taken into account in the concept. For example, not only to ensure availability, but also periodically to check whether services are still properly registered. Unauthorized services are to be deleted in the directory.

In addition, a manual should be developed, which also regulates the emergency operation in a business continuity plan. It takes into account the specificities of an SOA environment, analyzes the risks of serious harm and provides recommendations for emergency measures.
