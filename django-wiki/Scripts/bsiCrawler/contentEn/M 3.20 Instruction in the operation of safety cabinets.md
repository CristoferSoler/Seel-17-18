#M 3.20 Instruction in the operation of safety cabinets
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

After procuring a protective cabinet, users must be instructed in the correct operation. This should also be done when re-transferring a task that involves the use of the protective cabinet. At least the following points have to be conveyed:

* Proper handling of the lock of the protective cabinet must be performed. Typical errors include, for example, the undeclared code keys. The regulations for key administration, key deposit and substitution regulation are to be pointed out. In particular, it must be demanded that the protective cabinet be closed when not in use, even at short notice.
* The keyboard of a server must be kept in the server cabinet, so that unauthorized console entries can not be made.
* In the case of a server cabinet, it should be pointed out that unnecessary flammable materials (printouts, unnecessary manuals, printer paper) should not be stored in the server cabinet.
* Data backup devices of the server should be stored in another fire compartment. A storage in the server cabinet is therefore unsuitable and only permissible if one double of the backup data is stored in another fire compartment.
* If an air-conditioned server cabinet is used, the opening times of the server cabinet should be minimized. If necessary, check sporadically whether water has condensed in the server cabinet.
