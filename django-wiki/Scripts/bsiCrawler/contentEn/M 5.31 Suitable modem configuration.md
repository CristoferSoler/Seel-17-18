#M 5.31 Suitable modem configuration
Responsible for Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

Most modems work according to the Hayes standard (also called AT standard). This is a non-standard, manufacturer-dependent standard. The basic command sets of the various modems are largely the same. Larger deviations exist in the extended command sentences. It is important to check the instruction set of the modem used to determine how the functions described below are implemented and whether gaps in the configuration can lead to security gaps.

The selected settings should be stored in the non-volatile memory of the modem (see also M 1.38 Suitable installation of a modem). In addition, they should be printed on paper so that they can be compared to the current setting at any time.

Here are some security-related configurations:



## Examples 
* Are modems configured to leave no security holes open?
* Is the modem configuration documented?
* Preventing the unnoticed connection setup from outside: Is automatic call acceptance deactivated?
* Is the ability to remotely configure the modem disabled?
