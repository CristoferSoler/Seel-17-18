Responsible for Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Before starting security checks on individual network services and processes under Unix, it is first necessary to make an overview of which services must be made available at all and which services u. . U. already installed. For the latter, it helps to create a list of all network processes using the ps command and corresponding options. Then you should inform yourself about the task of each of these processes and where it is started with which options. Often this happens in the files / etc / rc, /etc/rc.net, /etc/rc.local, which are read when the system is booted.

Of particular importance is the inetd daemon, since it can start all the processes listed in the file /etc/inetd.conf. Also configuration files like / etc / services, / etc / protocols, / etc / hosts, / etc / gated.conf and others must be checked.
