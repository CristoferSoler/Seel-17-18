#G 3.27 Faulty time synchronization
If the system time on IT systems is not synchronized correctly, each system will work at a different time. This can lead to problems for the correct functioning or the availability of systems.

The following problems may occur:

* Significant time differences between IT systems may cause communication between systems to be disrupted, delayed, or rendered ineffective by messages in the other system.
* An overlapping event, such as the spread of malware via the network or a port scan carried out in the network, leaves traces on the individual systems (log entries, file accesses) with very different times. This makes it much harder to find out about the incident, because the individual tracks can not be safely brought together.
* In the investigation of computer crime, the probative value of computer-forensic traces can be severely limited if the correctness of the system time can not be proved.
* For time-dependent services such as license servers or OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) receivers, incorrect system time may cause the service to malfunction because, for example, licenses or certificates may be considered expired.
* If there is a failure of the time source in a network which uses the single reference method for time synchronization, no replacement time is available any more. As a result, file and object rights can be changed unchecked.
