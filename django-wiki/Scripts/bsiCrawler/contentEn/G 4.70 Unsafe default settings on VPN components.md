#G 4.70 Unsafe default settings on VPN components
The default settings of VPN components do not always have all the features of a secure installation. Often more attention is paid to usability and ease of integration with existing systems than security. Lack of adaptations to the concrete security requirements can therefore lead to avoidable weak points and thus to dangerous points of attack.

Since the encryption of a VPN channel can be attacked only with high expenditure with correct application, the VPN end points offer a simpler starting point for a break-in into a net. To prepare for an attack, an attacker first collects all available information via the VPN. Special tools are available on the Internet to facilitate such analyzes.



## Examples 
* A newly acquired VPN gateway is integrated into the internal network by the administrator of a company. Since it works reliably with the default settings straight away, the administrator does not change the chosen settings. However, the product allows factory remote administration with a known standard password. However, as the standard password is known to many users, this creates a risk for the secure operation of internal site networking.
