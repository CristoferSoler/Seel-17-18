#G 2.12 Insufficient documentation of the wiring
If, due to insufficient documentation, the exact position of pipes is not known, construction work outside or inside a building may result in damage to pipes. It can not be assumed that all cables and wires are installed in the installation zones in accordance with DIN EN 18080-3 Housing Electrical Installations - Part 3: Wiring and Arrangement of Equipment or Similar Standards. Concrete piping or cabling during concrete construction can lead to system-related changes in the position of the cabling during concreting. The construction method with gypsum plasterboard walls often leads to uncoordinated cabling. If cables and wires are laid in floors or ceilings, a geometric or direct ducting may have been selected. Accidental arrangements are also possible, so that no conclusions can be drawn on cables and ceilings on the basis of visible equipment (lights, switches, tank etc.). In case of failure due to damage to cables, it may lead to prolonged downtime or even to life-threatening hazards, eg. B.by electric shock, come.

Insufficient documentation also makes it difficult to inspect, maintain and repair cables.
