Crosstalk is a special form of crosstalk. The disturbance is not generally generated in the environment, but by currents and voltages of signals that are transmitted to an adjacent line. The strength of this effect depends on the cable structure (shielding, cable capacitance, insulation properties) and on the electrical parameters during information transmission (current, voltage, frequency).

Not every line that is influenced by crosstalk must influence others. The testing of individual lines for coupled-in external signals does not provide any information as to whether the own signals can be intercepted on other lines and thus can be listened to there.

The main difference to other line faults is that, in addition to the disruption of the signal transmission on adjacent lines, crosstalk may provide information that may be evaluable on other lines.
