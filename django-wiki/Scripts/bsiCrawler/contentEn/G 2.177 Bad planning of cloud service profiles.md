#G 2.177 Bad planning of cloud service profiles
Cloud service profiles consist of an information set that describes the cloud resources (eg, memory, CPU, storage) and the underlying configuration. This information is used to provision the cloud service.

A bad planning of cloud service profiles leads to the fact that the promised performance of a cloud service is not possible or prevented. A misplanning of cloud service profiles occurs when the configuration of the profiles or the associated cloud resources do not allow or prevent the promised performance of a cloud service. The same effect can be caused by unproven cloud service profiles.



## Examples 
* Configuring a cloud service profile uses a static path to point to a storage system. Access to this memory area is limited based on source addresses. A replication of the cloud service creates a different source address, which means that it no longer has access to the cloud storage. In this example, the configuration and data model of the cloud application are broken and are not designed for scalable automation of a cloud service.
* Cloud service profiles are not tested properly. As a result, cloud services are not provided correctly or in agreed manner.
