#G 0.5 natural disasters
Natural disasters are understood to mean natural changes that have devastating effects on people and infrastructures. Causes of a natural disaster can be seismic, climatic or volcanic phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, tsunamis, avalanches and volcanic eruptions. Examples of extreme meteorological phenomena are severe weather, hurricanes or cyclones. Depending on the location of the institution, it is exposed to varying degrees of risk due to the different types of natural disasters.



## Examples 
* For data centers in flood-prone areas, there is a high risk of water entering the building in an uncontrolled manner (flooding or rising groundwater levels).
* The frequency of earthquakes and thus the associated risk depend heavily on the geographical location.
* Extremely increased solar activity has in the past already led to a number of impairments of telecommunications infrastructures and energy supply.
