#G 3.67 Insufficient or incorrect configuration of the z / OS operating system
The configuration of a z / OS operating system is very complex and requires the intervention of the system administrator in many places. Weak or inadequate definitions quickly create vulnerabilities that can lead to corresponding security issues.



## Examples 
* On an OS / 390 system, an authorization SVC has been used in the past to perform certain functions under authorized TSO / ISPF. Mode (kernel mode). Although this vulnerability had been known for a long time, the SVC was also installed in newer z / OS environments and was available to every user.
