#M 2.43 Sufficient marking of the data carriers during shipping
Initiation Initiation: IT Security Officer, IT Leader, Organization Leader

Responsible for implementation: users

In addition to the implementation instructions outlined in Measure M 2.3 Data Carrier Management, care should be taken to ensure that the sender and (all) recipient can be identified immediately if the data carriers to be exchanged are sufficiently identified. The marking of the data carriers or their packaging must make the contents of the data carriers clearly identifiable to the recipient. However, it is important in the case of valuable information that this identification does not allow unauthorized persons to conclude on the nature and content of the stored information.

For classified information, the applicable security regulations must always be adhered to.

In addition, the data carriers should be marked with the formats used or the parameters required for readout. For example, it should be noted when transmitting DVDs, whether they are video, audio or data DVDs.

Date of shipment, possible version numbers or ordinal features may also be useful identifiers for data carriers.
