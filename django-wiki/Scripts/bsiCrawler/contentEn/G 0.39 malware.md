A malicious program is software designed to perform unwanted and usually harmful functions. The typical types of malicious programs include viruses, worms and Trojan horses. Malicious programs are usually secretly, without the knowledge and consent of the user active.

Malicious programs today offer an attacker extensive communication and control options and have a variety of functions. Among other things, malicious programs can specifically search passwords, remotely control systems, deactivate protection software and spy on data.

In particular, loss or misuse of information or applications is of major importance. But the loss of image and the financial damage that can result from malicious programs are also of great importance.



## Examples 
* In the past, the W32 / Bugbear malware spread in two ways: locating and copying local computers for shared access computers. It also sent itself as an HTML e-mail to recipients in the e-mail address book of infected computers. Due to an error in the HTML routine of certain e-mail programs, the malicious program was executed there at the opening of the message without further intervention of the recipient.
* The malware program W32 / Klez spread in different variants. Infected computers sent the virus to all recipients in the computer's e-mail address book. If this virus had infested a computer, it prevented the installation of virus protection programs of common manufacturers by continuous manipulations on the operating system and thus made the disinfection of the affected computers considerably more difficult.
