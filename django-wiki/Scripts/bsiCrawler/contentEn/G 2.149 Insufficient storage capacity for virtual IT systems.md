#G 2.149 Insufficient storage capacity for virtual IT systems
Virtualization servers require storage for the operation of the virtual IT systems, either locally in the virtualization server itself or in a storage network. If the storage capacities required for this are not planned sufficiently large, there are far-reaching risks for the availability of the virtual IT systems and the integrity of the information processed in them. This is especially true if special virtualization functions, such as snapshots or overbooking of storage space, are used. Bottlenecks can affect not only the space on hard disks or in storage networks, but also the main memory (RAM).
