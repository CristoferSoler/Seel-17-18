#M 2.410 Regulated commissioning of a directory service
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If it is decided to discontinue a directory service because it is replaced by a newer version on new hardware, for example, the following points should be observed.

The decommissioning of a directory service must be carefully planned and conscientiously carried out so that, for example, authorized users can continue to log in and the necessary access to resources in the network is ensured and, on the other hand, data and rights that are no longer available be kept safe, be safely deleted or permanently withdrawn.

Before commissioning, check whether a backup of the directory service is available, with the help of which the directory service can be restored if problems arise in the network.

This also applies to encrypted data that is stored on other computers in the network of the institution, but whose relevant key information is part of the directory service. If the directory service includes a certification authority, cryptographic keys and certificates may be affected by the termination. Then check whether an explicit backup of the key material is to be made.

In the case where the directory service to be outsourced provides information that is still needed for particular purposes or applications, care must be taken to ensure that such information is sufficiently available from other sources ,
