#M 1.11 Maps of utilities
Responsible for initiation: Head of Domestic Engineering

Responsible for implementation: building services

Precise maps of all supply lines (electricity, water, gas, telephone, danger message, pipe post etc.) must be kept in the building and on the corresponding property and all matters concerning the pipes must be included:

* precise guidance of the lines (marking in the floor plan and floor plans),
* exact technical data (type and dimensions),
* possibly existing marking,
* Use of the lines, naming the connected network participants,
* Danger points and
* existing and tested security measures.


It must be possible to get an accurate picture of the situation quickly and easily based on the plans. Only then can the risk of accidentally damaging cables during work be reduced to a minimum. A damaged area can be localized faster and the malfunction can be remedied faster.

It must be ensured that all work on cables is documented in good time and in full. It is therefore necessary to clarify who is responsible for maintaining and updating the location plans of all supply lines. The plots are to be kept safe as they contain valuable information. They are to be stored in such a way that only authorized persons can access them, but if necessary they are quickly available.
