#G 2.208 Inadequate physical security of electronic components in embedded systems
If an embedded system is physically accessible, it can provide a gateway with access to a variety of attacks. A system can be physically destroyed or damaged, eg. Due to mechanical force, short circuits or overvoltages. It can be logically analyzed after mechanical, chemical and physical preliminary work. Once a door has physical access to the electronic components, e.g. B.IC pins, contacts, etc .., He can record the electrical signals unnoticed directly with appropriate measurement and analysis tools and feed even signals.
