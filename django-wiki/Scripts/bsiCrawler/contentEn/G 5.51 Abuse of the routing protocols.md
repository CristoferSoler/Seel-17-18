#G 5.51 Abuse of the routing protocols
Routing protocols such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP) or Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) are used to forward changes in the routes between two networked systems to the systems involved, thereby enabling a dynamic modification of the routing tables. It is easily possible to create incorrect RIP packets and thus configure undesired routes.

The use of dynamic routing makes it possible to send routing information to a computer, which usually uses it unproperly to set up its routing tables. This can be exploited by an attacker to specifically change the transmission path.
