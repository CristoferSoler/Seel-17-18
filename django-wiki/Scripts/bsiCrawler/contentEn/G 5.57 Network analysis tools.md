#G 5.57 Network analysis tools
If the information transmitted in the network segment is not encrypted, this information can be read in plain text using network analysis tools, so-called sniffers.

Modern management tools today include functions that can be used to read data packets to analyze problems in networks. Attackers may use these extra features to extract sensitive data. In addition to IP networks, Fiber Channel connections are also endangered by network analysis tools. Different manufacturers now offer free access to physical FC analyzers, which can be used to read traffic. This allows the stored data to be retrieved from storage networks without having to access the physical data carriers. Used at an unsecured central hub, this creates an enormous risk to compromise the confidentiality of the data.

An additional danger through the use of network analysis tools is the access of service providers to leased lines.
