#G 5.122 Abuse of RACF attributes on z / OS
In the z / OS security system RACF, the attributes SPECIAL, OPERATIONS and AUDITOR are equipped with particularly high authorizations.



## Examples 
* A system programmer did not have the attribute SPECIAL. He wrote a special program and put it in an APF-authorized file. He needed access to the APF files for his regular work. The self-written program allowed the system programmer to assign the SPECIAL attribute and make unauthorized changes to RACF settings.
