#G 3.35 Switch off server during operation
If a network is managed by a management system, there are special purpose servers (especially in the area of ??system management). On the so-called management servers databases are usually held with management information. If such servers are simply turned off during operation, soz. B. the data held in the memory of the computer is no longer written to the file system. As a result, inconsistencies can also exist in the management data when the machine is next started. As a result, large management systems typically use databases that use transactional mechanisms to ensure that the information can be restored to an (old) consistent state. This reduces the risk, but can not completely eliminate it and can even be exploited (exploiting an old configuration with less restrictive access rights).

Errors may also occur with electronic archiving if the archive system is switched off completely or partially during operation. Switching off may result in documents being archived, but actually written only incompletely or not at all on the storage medium and therefore can no longer be reproduced.

Stand: 5th EL as of October 2003
