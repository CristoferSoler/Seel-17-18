#M 4.316 Monitoring the Active Directory Infrastructure
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The security status of the Active Directory infrastructure is monitored and evaluated by logging the native events. The log depth is to be adapted to the respective requirements and should be continuously monitored.

The log data should be evaluated regularly. In addition, they should be compared with a reference value, which can be determined, for example, from previous data.



## Examples 
* Percentage processor utilization (upper limit: 80%)
* Free space on disk with the Active Directory database in percent (lower limit: 25%)
* Available memory in percent (lower limit: 10%)
* Binding time for LDAP connections (Notably, there would be an unusually large increase in the binding time.)
* Number of successful LDAP connections per second (Noticeably, there would be an unusually large increase in LDAP connections, depending on the amount of LDAP connections within the organization.)
