#M 6.104 Redundancies for building cabling
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: building services, IT manager

In the case of high or very high availability requirements, consideration should be given to redundantly designing the secondary and tertiary cabling in the relevant buildings.

For this purpose, the secondary cabling, ie the connection of the floors, is led via at least two risers, which should be located in different fire compartments of the building. For example, the secondary cabling could be routed to the opposite sides of the building (eg North and South or East and West).

All rooms where subscribers are to be supplied are connected to both secondary cabling. Half of the connections in one room are then connected to a distributor on one side of the building, the other half of the connections are connected to a distributor on the other side of the building. In the following illustration, the two building halves are schematically referred to as left and right sides.



Thus, even in the case of serious damage, it is possible to at least temporarily maintain operation on the floors, provided that the damage does not affect both building halves.
