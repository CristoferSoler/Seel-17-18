#G 5.129 Manipulation of data through the storage system
A badly configured SAN installation can create an unwanted connection between networks. A serious risk to the internal data of an institution can be found, for example. occur when a server with a SAN connection can be reached from the Internet and is thus compromised from the outside.

The connection of a server connected to the storage system, which is not sufficiently isolated from the Internet, can also lead to the compromising of the storage system if the server is compromised. For example, data in the SAN associated with other machines may be read or changed.

Since all security and surveillance measures, such as firewalls or IDS (intrusion detection systems), are passed over in the IT networks of the institution, the potential for damage is very high.
