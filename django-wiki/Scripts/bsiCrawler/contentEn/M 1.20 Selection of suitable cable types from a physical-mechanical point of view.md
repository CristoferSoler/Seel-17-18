#M 1.20 Selection of suitable cable types from a physical-mechanical point of view
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Planner, Head of Domestic Engineering, Head of IT

When selecting cables, in addition to the transmission requirements, consideration must also be given to the ambient conditions during installation and operation. In order to meet these different requirements, cable manufacturers offer different types of cables on the market or develop appropriate solutions.

With regard to the cable sheath for indoor or outdoor installation, the following criteria must be taken into account:

* Temperature,
* surrounding medium (water, sewage, acid, gas, light),
* Rodent protection, slash and spade stab resistance, stone chip resistance, water pressure resistance,
* Functional integrity in fire-prone areas,
* special pulls through z. B. Overhead use.


In addition, the planned road systems are to be considered, such as cable trays, cable ladder, Kabelkan le, Kabelzugrohre, Kabelformsteine, climbing areas and overhead lines.

The further cable construction must take into account the following factors:

* Tensile forces through mechanical installation, z. As cable winch, Einblassystem or manual installation,
* Bending radius and transverse pressure stability, according to laying mode and idle state during operation,
* Damp or wet areas due to L ngswasserschutz,
* special pulling forces in the installed state, which arise due to large clamping or intercepting distances for overhead lines or extreme gradients,
* strong electrical and inductive power surges through cable shielding.


The correct and compliant selection of electric cables and compliance with the relevant standards (DINVDE 0100 regulations for the erection of power installations with nominal voltages up to 1000 V, DIN 4102 fire behavior of building materials and components) and regulations as well as the Recognized rules of technology represents the basic emergency preparedness of the electrical installation.

Individual requirements for the selection of cables may not be defined exclusively by the IT itself, especially in operating environments in which environmental influences or special structural conditions are to be observed. In particular, personnel in the building services, who are familiar with operating procedures and other special conditions, must be involved in the planned cable routing, in determining the relevant influences and thus the special requirements for the execution of cables.
