#M 4.328 Secure basic configuration of a Samba server
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

After the Samba server has been installed, a secure basic configuration of the service must be established. This affects, among other things, the settings for the access controls, but also settings that affect the performance of the server.

The central configuration file of Samba is the file smb.conf. Usually this is located in the directory / etc / samba /. This configuration file distinguishes between one global and several release-specific configuration sections. Release-specific configuration sections are indicated by the fact that these sections begin with a label that is not [global]. Parameters that are in the global section are generally valid. On the other hand, parameters in release-specific sections are only valid for the release to which they refer. All configuration parameters are described in the documentation, or manpage, for smb.conf.

The following are the main configuration settings:



## Examples 
* user-level
* share-level
