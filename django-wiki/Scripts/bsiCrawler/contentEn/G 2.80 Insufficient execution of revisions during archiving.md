#G 2.80 Insufficient execution of revisions during archiving
Electronic archiving places very high demands on the process of converting paper documents into electronic documents. The activities to be performed during the archiving should be described in detail in a process documentation and be made comprehensible by a logging which records which user performed which activities in the archive and when.

Inadequate and inaccurate checking of the work processes during archiving or the recorded log data can indirectly lead to doubts about the correctness of the archiving process and thus the correctness of the archived documents themselves.
