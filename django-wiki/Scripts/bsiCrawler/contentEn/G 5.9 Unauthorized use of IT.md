#G 5.9 Unauthorized use of IT
The identification and authentication of users should prevent the use of information technology without authorization. But even in IT systems with an identification and authentication function in the form of user ID and password verification unauthorized use is conceivable when the access data are spied out.

In order to guess a secret password, unauthorized persons can enter a possible password within the login function. The reaction of the IT system then provides information about whether the password was correct or not. In this way, passwords can be guessed by trial and error.

More promising, however, is the attack, to accept a meaningful word as a password and to try all user entries. With a correspondingly large number of users, a valid combination is often found.

If the identification and authentication function is abusive, it is even possible to automatically start experiments by creating a program that systematically tests all possible passwords.

Example:

* Malicious software exploited a vulnerability in a Unix operating system to find valid passwords even though the passwords were encrypted. For this, a program tried out all the entries in a dictionary by encrypting them with the available encryption function and comparing the result with the stored encrypted passwords. As soon as a match was found, a valid password was recognized.
