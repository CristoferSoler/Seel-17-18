#G 5.15 Abuse of features of PBXs
Traditional PBX systems typically have a variety of features to provide users with the convenience of communication and the widest possible adaptation to their work environment. However, some features may also be misused for targeted attacks, in particular for confidentiality or availability.



## Examples 
* The functions of direct call and automatic call acceptance can be misused in connection with a hands-free function on telephones to listen to rooms.
* In the case of a call diversion, the unavailability of the telephone connection of a user may be the result of accidental or malicious misuse.
* Dial-in functionality allows remote access for mobile workers, but can also be used for attacks such as fee fraud.
* The conference call function could be exploited in the background for an unnoticed connection.
* Functions such as witness handover or wiretapping, which are prohibited in Germany from exporting features of telecommunications systems, could be used for unnoticed listening to telephone conversations.
