#M 5.144 Downsizing of IT cabling
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Head of Domestic Engineering

If IT cabling is finally no longer required, it must be removed professionally. While the tertiary wiring is often used as long as the building itself, in the field of secondary cabling and in the internal cabling of server rooms and technical rooms, it is more common for existing cables to pass through more powerful ones are replaced.

Unfortunately, the old cables are often not removed in a rewiring in practice, but the new cables are laid on the old cable. This applies to the laying trays and especially double sheets. Such a procedure worsens the clarity and increases the existing fire loads. In addition, the deterioration of the air flow can cause air conditioning problems. Therefore, it is recommended to plan the route assignment in advance with regard to a later decay and to control the post-wiring. A resulting extension of the routes is to be considered in time. It is therefore necessary to set up an overview of cables that are no longer needed and to document the dismantling / dismantling of the cables on the basis of this documentation. Subsequently, the documentation listing the IT cabling stock needs to be updated.
