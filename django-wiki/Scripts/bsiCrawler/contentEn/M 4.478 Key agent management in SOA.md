#M 4.478 Key agent management in SOA
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In a service-oriented architecture (SOA), services must be able to identify in the same way as users or roles. This implies that the associated identity protection is associated with an automatically generated asymmetric key pair and the subsequent automatic certificate generation and publication.

To make attacks on the associated certification process more difficult, the certificate processes must be housed in a sealed trusted key store. The private key of the SOA service may not leave the Trusted Key Store. To administer the certification processes, the SOA service is assigned a key management service (XMLKey Management Service, XKMS). The SOA service and XKMS communicate locally, thereby reducing the possibility of attack on the key elements used. As a local CA, the XKMS must sign the public key of the SOA service and publish it as valid in its own information domain.
