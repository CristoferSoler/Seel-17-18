#M 4.275 Safe operation of a storage solution
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

A storage solution usually runs largely autonomously, without the need for administrators to intervene. However, to safeguard the operation, there are some measures that must be taken if the functionality of a memory solution is to be available without problems permanently and without interruption. The monitoring of the operation is realized by a management system (see M 2.359 Monitoring and management of storage solutions).



## Examples 
* Applications, system programs: Make sure that utilities run smoothly. To this belongs. For example, antivirus software or schedulers that can control automated tasks such as automatic backup.
* Capacity control and system utilization: It must be ensured that capacity limits of storage systems are not exceeded and bottlenecks on storage systems or in the storage network are recognized in good time so that countermeasures can be taken.
* Monitoring of critical events: It must be ensured that safety-critical settings are not changed and all safety requirements are met. Events that violate essential safety rules must be reported clearly.
* Reduce System Messages: System messages should be reduced so that only really important messages are displayed.
