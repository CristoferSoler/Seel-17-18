#G 4.63 Dusty fans
IT devices, like all other electrical devices, should only be operated within a temperature range specified by the manufacturer. Compliance with the minimum temperature usually makes no special demands. On the other hand, additional equipment usually has to be operated in order to be able to maintain the maximum temperature. Most of these facilities have in common that the surplus heat is dissipated by means of fans.

There is always a certain amount of dust in the ambient air, even in the air of normal B ro- or Serverr umen. Since this partly settles on filters, there are usually formed over time mostly sizable dust pads. These dust accumulations can

* Reduce the air flow and thus the cooling effect of the fans to such an extent that appliances overheat and fail or become inflamed (especially with power supply units).
* slow down or completely stop the fan running freely, causing the now-blocked fan motor to overheat and become the ignition source.
