#M 2.224 Prevention of malware
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, user

Absolute protection against malicious programs does not exist. Therefore, it is particularly important to keep telling users about the threat of malware.

Furthermore, the security concept against malicious programs must cover all IT systems that must be protected against malicious programs within a networked structure. Virus protection programs should be placed in such a way that all possible infection routes are covered (see also M 2.154 Creating a security concept against malicious programs).

By following some important rules of behavior and recommendations, the risk of malware infection can be reduced:

* Regularly updated virus protection programs should be used.
* All files and programs received from third parties should be checked for possible malicious software before activation. This check should be done as automated as possible.
* Malicious programs can be embedded in active contents of web pages (eg Java, JavaScript and especially ActiveX). An execution is possible without the user noticing this. It should be considered to configure the Internet browser so that, for example, active content can not even be loaded on your own computer or may come from trusted sites.
* Malware often has the purpose of identifying passwords or other credentials. Therefore, passwords should never be stored on the IT systems.
* Sender details in e-mails without corresponding additional security mechanisms are not trustworthy. Sender names or reply addresses are very easy to delete. Even if the sender details are correct and the sender is trustworthy, it can not be assumed that the sender has knowingly sent the e-mail. A malicious program on his computer can read out the address book and automatically generate e-mails. Therefore, no e-mail attachments or other received files should be opened if the e-mail contains a peculiar subject line or an unusual message text. In case of doubt, the communication partners should ask if they have actually sent the messages.
* When exchanging emails, as far as possible digital signatures should be used to check the authenticity and correctness of the email content (see M 4.34 Using Encryption, Checksum or Digital Signatures). ,
* Many data and programs are available through various sources, such as: Via mirror servers on the Internet or via magazine CD-ROMs. In principle, data and programs should only be downloaded from trustworthy sources, in particular from the original web pages or original data carriers of the creator (see also M 4.177 Ensuring the Integrity and Authenticity of Software Packages ).
* In principle, all programs should be checked before installation and release on test systems with regard to functional safety and in terms of infestation by malicious programs (see also M 4.65 Testing new hardware and software).
* For CERTs or other security-related information services, regular research should be carried out to determine whether programs have been used to transmit data from the IT system of the user without his knowledge to other IT systems (see also M 2.35 Information about security) Descken of the system). Such problems have not only affected some applications in the past, but also certain program libraries. Some of the programmers who had used these libraries were not aware of any user information being shared with third parties.
* When installing programs, the program instructions and conditions of use should be read carefully. Often they even (more or less clearly) point out that when using the program, certain user or system data is collected and passed on.
* Most modern operating systems today already contain integrated packet filters. These packet filtering features should be enabled on as many IT systems as possible. In particular, for Windows operating systems special personal firewalls are also available, which in addition to the pure packet filter function also provide other security functions, such as registry or process monitoring. It should be checked on which IT systems the use of an additional personal firewall is required.
* The user rights on clients and other terminals should be restricted as much as possible. This also means that as far as possible only such applications are operated, for which no administrator rights are required. The more rights a user has, the greater the likelihood that a malicious program that has entered this way will work and become more deeply embedded in the system.
* The protection of a network must not be limited to the external borders. To protect confidential data internally secure subnets must be formed, which are as well as possible isolated against other network areas. Proper network segmentation with adequate protection of internal network boundaries limits the possibilities of malicious programs.
* If the defense of a malicious program has failed and has been able to activate malicious activity, it should be detected as quickly as possible by its behavior. The greatest opportunities are provided by close monitoring of the network. Network activities and e-mail traffic should therefore be regularly monitored and logged. Often the activity of malicious programs is shown by unwanted traffic. In particular, unusually large volumes of data transmitted, repeated transmissions at specific time intervals or a noticeable increase in the number of emails to be transmitted may be considered. Intrusion detection systems can support the automatic search for such abnormalities.
* With regard to preventive measures against keyloggers a special feature has to be considered. Because keylogger distribution is legal in many countries, virus protection software vendors often do not include it in their signature database. The actual detection of keyloggers by the virus protection program should be clear. If in doubt, a program specialized in finding keyloggers should also be used.
* Not only regular program files may contain malicious programs, but also files of application programs that use a macro language (macro viruses). Affected are, among other things, the common office programs (such as word processing or spreadsheets) of most manufacturers. Many application programs provide setting options that increase protection against macro malware. For example, when opening files, executing macros can be prevented by default. On this topic, the corresponding recommendations of the application program manufacturers should be checked and compared with their own security requirements. As a further precaution, users should be advised of how to prevent the automatic execution of any existing macros. This is unfortunately different for almost all programs and versions and not always reliable.
