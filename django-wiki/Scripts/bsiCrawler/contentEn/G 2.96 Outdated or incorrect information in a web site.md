#G 2.96 Outdated or incorrect information in a web site
The correctness and timeliness of the information that an organization publishes in a web offer not only has an impact on the success of the web offer alone. If false information is published on the Internet, the reputation of the organization may be severely damaged in the public.

In some cases, financial losses or legal consequences (such as warnings) are also threatened if false information is published. The effects can be even worse if, in error, internal (confidential or even secret) information reaches the web server, which should not actually be published.

Even if certain information on the web server is just outdated, it can have adverse effects. If, for example, outdated contact information is published, this can lead to a disruption of the affected business processes.



## Examples 
* In 2002, reporters found a file on the web server of a Swedish company containing a quarterly report from that company, which was due to be released several days later. Among other things, this led to temporary price losses of the company's shares.
