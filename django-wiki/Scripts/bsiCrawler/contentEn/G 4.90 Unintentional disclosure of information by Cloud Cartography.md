#G 4.90 Unintentional disclosure of information by Cloud Cartography
The goal of Cloud Cartography is to map the cloud service provider's infrastructure to determine where a particular virtual machine is operating. With successful cloud cartography, an attacker obtains a detailed picture of the cloud service provider's internal network structure from information about accessible cloud elements. This information can be used as the basis for further attacks.

By querying both from outside and from within the cloud, it is possible to determine the basic layout of the network: Whois queries are used to determine public IP address ranges. Web content download tools tell you which servers are running the HTTP service, and you can use cloud internal DNS queries to find private IP addresses and, if necessary, hostnames. A valuable result for an attacker could be to map the geographic availability and rentable virtual performance classes of the cloud services or their associated virtual machines to the internal IP address spaces. In some circumstances, static associations of virtual entities to physical cloud resources may lead to prioritized targets. Using a variety of techniques, an attacker can determine if a self-launched virtual entity in the cloud is adjacent to a foreign virtual entity, that is, on the same physical machine. The foreign virtual instance thus becomes a possible attack target.
