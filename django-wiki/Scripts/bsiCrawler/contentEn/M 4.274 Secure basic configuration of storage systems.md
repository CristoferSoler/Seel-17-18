#M 4.274 Secure basic configuration of storage systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

All configuration work on storage systems must be performed in accordance with the security policy that has been established (see M 2.525 Creating a security policy for storage solutions) and documented and commented on by storage systems as described in M .2.358 Documentation of System Settings.



## Examples 
* Local Configuration: Checking and adjusting the configuration parameters related to the device itself (for example, setting RAID levels, mapping hard drives to volumes, mapping backup devices to storage devices), settings for Logging, settings for console access etc.
* Network configuration: Checking and adjusting the configuration parameters related to the integration of the device into the local area network, the administration network and the storage network. Administration services such as telnet, tftp, or http, where login and all information are exchanged in plain text, should be replaced by the encoded equivalents ssh, sftp, and https.
* For SAN systems, the internal segmentation of the network must be done by zoning and port binding. The attached servers should be allocated only the resources actually needed by the SAN.
* The administration of the storage systems should be integrated into the central rights management (eg Active Directory, LDAP, Radius, ...).
