#G 2.32 Insufficient line capacity
When planning networks, it is often the mistake to base the capacity design solely on current needs. It overlooks the fact that the capacity requirements for networks are constantly increasing, eg when new IT systems are integrated into the network, new services are offered in the network or the volume of data transmitted increases.

If the capacity of a network is no longer sufficient, the transmission rate may drop, the access times may increase and, if necessary, accessibility in the network may be severely limited for the respective users.
