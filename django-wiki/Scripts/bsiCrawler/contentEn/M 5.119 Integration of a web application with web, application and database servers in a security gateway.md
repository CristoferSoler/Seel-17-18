Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

In order to provide a complex web application ALGALG (for example an e-government application or an online shop), further protection measures are necessary due to the increased protection requirements. In the following, a standard structure for providing a web application consisting of web server, application server and database server is proposed for this special case.



## Examples 
* For web applications that are accessed only from a relatively trusted network, the simplified architecture usually provides a sufficient level of security.
* If the web application is an Internet-accessible application, or if the processed data has a high protection requirement, then at least one reverse HTTP proxy should be used to secure the web server against attacks from the Internet.
* If further databases are operated on the database server belonging to the web application, the protection requirements of these data must also be taken into consideration. In this case, the secure and careful configuration of the database server is of particular importance. In this case, the use of a security proxies for database access is strongly recommended.
