#M 6.50 Archiving of data
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

If it is necessary to archive data from a database system, a corresponding concept must be created to ensure that the data can be made available again completely and consistently at a later date , Here are the following points to consider:



## Examples 
* The available archiving options must be identified.
* It must be documented which data model underlies the data to be archived.
* The time of archiving has to be documented.
* The version of the database management system and the utilities used must be documented.
* Structure, systematics and order criteria of the archive must be specified.
* For all archival media, a maximum physical lifetime is to be determined on the basis of manufacturer information and empirical values. Accordingly, times must be set for refreshing the archived data.
* The required availability of the archived data must be checked regularly and, if necessary, adapted to the specific requirements. Necessary adjustments affect, among other things, the choice of archiving medium and the way in which it is archived. In the case of high availability requirements, it may be necessary to keep several historical versions of the same databases accessible in parallel.
* It must be ensured that specified retention periods are adhered to.
