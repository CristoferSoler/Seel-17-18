#M 4.42 Implementation of security functionalities in the IT application
Responsible for initiation: Data protection officer, IT security officer, person responsible for the individual applications, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Developer

Several reasons can lead to the need to implement within the application programs even security functionalities such as access control, access rights management and checking or logging:

* If the logging capabilities of the IT system, including additional security products, are insufficient to ensure sufficient evidence, these log elements must be implemented in the application program. (Example: BDSG, attachment to   9, input control: to ensure that it is subsequently possible to check and determine which personal data has been entered by whom in data processing systems at what time.)
* If the granularity of the access rights of the IT system, including additional security products, is insufficient to ensure proper operation, access rights management and control must be implemented in the application program. (Example: a database with a common database, provided that depending on the function of the user, only access to certain fields is permitted.)
* If the IT system, including any additional security products deployed, prevents the administrator from accessing or at least logging and accessing that data, additional security features may be required be implemented in the application program. For example, encrypting the data can prevent the administrator from reading this data in plain text when it is not in possession of the associated key.


These additional requirements for IT applications must already be taken into account in planning and development, as subsequent implementation is usually no longer possible for cost reasons.
