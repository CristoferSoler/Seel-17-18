#G 0.23 Unauthorized intrusion into IT systems
In principle, any interface to an IT system not only includes the ability to legitimately use certain services of the IT system, but also the risk of unauthorized access to the IT system.



## Examples 
* If a user ID and the associated password are spied out, unauthorized use of the applications or IT systems protected by this is conceivable.
* Hackers could gain unauthorized access to IT systems via insufficiently secured remote maintenance access.
* With insufficiently secured interfaces of active network components, it is conceivable that attackers gain unauthorized access to the network component. In addition, if they succeed in overcoming the local security mechanisms, e.g. have gained administrative privileges, they could exercise all administrative duties.
* Many IT systems have interfaces for the use of exchangeable data memories, such as. Additional memory cards or USB storage media. In the case of an unattended IT system with the corresponding hardware and software, there is a risk that unauthorized reading of large amounts of data or the introduction of malicious programs can occur.
