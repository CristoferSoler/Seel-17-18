#G 0.12 Electromagnetic interference radiation
Information technology today consists to a large extent of electronic components. Although optical transmission technology is also increasingly being used, computers, network coupling elements and memory systems, for example, generally contain a large number of electronic components. Electromagnetic interference radiation acting on such components may impair or even impair the functioning of electronic devices. As a result, failures, faults, incorrect processing results or communication errors can occur.

Even wireless communication can be affected by electromagnetic radiation. For this purpose, a sufficient disturbance of the frequency bands used may be sufficient under certain circumstances.

Furthermore, information stored on certain types of data carriers may be erased or corrupted by electromagnetic interference. This applies in particular to magnetizable data carriers (hard disks, magnetic tapes, etc.) and to semiconductor memories. Damage to such data carriers by electromagnetic radiation is also possible.

There are many different sources of electromagnetic fields or radiation, for example radio networks such as WLAN, Bluetooth, GSM, UMTS etc., permanent magnets and cosmic radiation. In addition, each electrical device emits more or less strong electromagnetic waves, which can spread through the air and along metallic conductors (eg cables, air conditioning ducts, heating pipes, etc.).

In Germany, the Act on Electromagnetic Compatibility of Equipment (EMVG) contains provisions on this topic.
