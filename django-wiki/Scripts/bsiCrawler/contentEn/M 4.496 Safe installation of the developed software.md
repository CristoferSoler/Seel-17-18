#M 4.496 Safe installation of the developed software
Responsible for initiation: Head of Development

Responsible for implementation: Developer, Head of Development

The prerequisite for a safe installation of the finished software in the production environment is a successful test according to a previously defined test procedure (see M 2.568 Test Procedure for Software).

Furthermore, the operating procedures must be tested for reliability in order to exclude defects during productive operation. In addition, emergency plans must be available if any problems occur during installation or operation of the software. These must contain instructions for foreseeable problem cases and at least one contact person, which the user can contact directly. In addition, the administrators must be trained in the support of the software. This includes knowledge of how the software is configured and also extended knowledge of how the software is used in production, so that users can be assisted in case of problems. Furthermore, users should have been familiarized with the system, for example through preparatory training or provided documentation.

An installation plan must exist for the installation process, which describes in detail all the steps to be performed and also takes into account possible sources of error or deviations between different target systems. After installation, the correct installation is checked using a documented test plan and the system is released for operation.
