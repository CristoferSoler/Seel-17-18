#G 2.174 Lack of or insufficient data protection control
Controlling compliance with applicable data protection rules, and in particular controlling technical and organizational measures, will often be inadequate if it is unjustifiably seen as an unproductive cost factor. The data protection control can also be made very difficult if it is ensured to include their requirements already during the development and testing of procedures.

Effective work for data protection control is usually not ensured if no data protection officer is appointed in a company or a public agency, or if the existing data protection officer is not sufficiently qualified or trained, or if he does not provide sufficient support informed in due time (insufficient personnel and material resources).



## Examples 
* The Head of the Data Center will be appointed Internal Privacy Officer, as he will provide the Office with the best expertise. The resulting conflict of interest is overlooked. This includes, for example, the fact that he would have to monitor the security requirements that he has set for the operation of IT procedures or monitor data that was stored for fraud detection as a data protection officer.
* An internal privacy policy will be adopted, after which an annual report by the data protection officer will be submitted. However, the appointed data protection officer has been permanently ill for 2 years and a representative has not been appointed so that no report is produced.
