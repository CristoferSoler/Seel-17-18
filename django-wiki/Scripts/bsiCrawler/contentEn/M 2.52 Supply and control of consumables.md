#M 2.52 Supply and control of consumables
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Head of Internal Service

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, User, Internal Service

Many devices used in everyday office work, such as faxes, printers, etc., depend on certain consumables (eg paper, toner, backup tapes) to be able to function. Therefore, the supply of these consumables must be ensured on site. There should be clear and unambiguous rules as to which consumables are being replenished or ordered by whom.

Certain resources may not be replenished or procured by any employee, but only by authorized persons, for example, very expensive products or technically complex components.

All users should be aware of who to notify when consumables need to be replenished or replenished. For each type of consumable material, someone responsible for supply and control should be designated. This responsible person makes sure that

* Regular checks are carried out to determine whether sufficient supplies are available and must be replenished on site.
* the procuring body is notified in good time if consumables need to be reordered,
* consumed or empty consumables are disposed of properly, and
* the consumables are replaced on the device if this is not to be done by the users.


The supply of consumer goods must be sufficiently ensured by the procuring entity.
