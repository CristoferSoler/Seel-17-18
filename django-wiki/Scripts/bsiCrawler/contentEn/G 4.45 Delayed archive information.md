#G 4.45 Delayed archive information
Delays in recovering archived documents can disrupt or hinder business processes in which context an archive request is made. For such delays many causes come into consideration, for example:

* outdated archive server software,


* unfavorable choice of index and search criteria when filing or searching archived data,


* Overloaded hardware of the archive server or involved database server,


* Delays in the network as well


* unbalanced ratio of storage media to drives.


In the latter case two cases have to be distinguished:

* If a drive with a single storage medium, which has a very large capacity, is used for the archiving, the response times can become very large, because only one user at a time can access the archive at the same time. All other requests are cached and then processed sequentially.


* With a large number of small storage media, only a few drives are available in relation to this. Therefore, the data carriers have to be changed frequently in case of requests, which leads to longer response times. Small storage media are also faster in their storage space exhausted (see G 4.20 overload of information systems).


Delays can also occur when documents are added to the archive, for example if the confirmation of the archiving process is delayed by long transmission times in the LAN.
