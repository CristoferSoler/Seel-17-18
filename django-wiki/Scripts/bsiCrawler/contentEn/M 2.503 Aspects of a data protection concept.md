#M 2.503 Aspects of a data protection concept
Responsible for Initiation: Data Protection Officer, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Data Protection Officer, IT Security Officer

For a company or a public authority, it is necessary to specify and document which data protection requirements must be complied with when processing personal data and how these requirements have been implemented. This means that many cases in which detailed examinations and the creation of an individual data protection concept are too costly for individual procedures can be treated as a lump sum. Furthermore, this provides a basis that is generally applicable to all IT systems and also applicable to new IT systems for which no data protection concept has yet been developed.

Priority must, of course, be given to the applicable statutory provisions. In this environment, however, there are generally valid aspects to be taken into account when processing personal data. The above aspects should also serve as a guide for individual privacy concepts.

The purpose of the data protection concept is to present the data protection aspects in a comprehensive documentation and can also be used as a basis for data protection-related examinations.
