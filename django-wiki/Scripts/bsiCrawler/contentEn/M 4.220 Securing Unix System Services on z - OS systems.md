#M 4.220 Securing Unix System Services on z / OS systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, specialist responsible

Unix System Services (USS) is a Posix-compatible subsystem running under the z / OS operating system. For the general protection of Unix System Services, the measures described in block B 3.102 Server under Unix must be implemented. Furthermore, some additional safety aspects have to be considered:



## Examples 
* Is it ensured that the UIDs under USS are not assigned twice in the z / OS system?
* Are zFS and HFS files that include the Unix file system protected under z / OS over RACF file profiles?
* Is the root file system for USS of the z / OS system being mounted with the option READ-ONLY?
* Is it ensured that there is no APF authorization through the File Security Packet in the USS file system of the z / OS system?
* Are the same mechanisms used for auditing and monitoring the US as for z / OS?
