#M 4.383 Secure installation of OpenLDAP
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

When installing OpenLDAP, there are several aspects to consider that have a direct impact on security. This measure can only give hints on points to pay particular attention to. It refers to the installation of OpenLDAP from the source code. Binaries from operating system vendors or distributors may deviate from this, so they usually resolve the dependencies on other applications on their own. The documentation provided with OpenLDAP, in particular the man pages and the help output of the configure script provide further information.



## Examples 
* Are the ports that are free for the slapd server enabled when a local packet filter is used?
* Is the installation of OpenLDAP comprehensibly documented?
* Are only backends and overlays translated for OpenLDAP, which are also used?
* Is it checked if applications that depend on OpenLDAP are installed in a compatible version?
