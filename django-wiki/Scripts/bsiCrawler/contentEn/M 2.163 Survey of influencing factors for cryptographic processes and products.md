#M 2.163 Survey of influencing factors for cryptographic processes and products
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, responsible for the individual applications

Before a decision can be made as to which cryptographic methods and products should be used, a number of influencing factors must be determined. For this, the system administrators and the persons responsible for the individual IT systems or IT applications can be interviewed. The results are comprehensible to document.

The following influencing factors are to be determined for all storage locations and transmission distances specified in M 2.162 Needs Assessment for the use of cryptographic methods and products:



## Examples 
* What kind of protection is required, what is the level of security needed to be achieved?
* Which cryptographic functions are necessary for this (encryption, integrity protection, authenticity and / or non-repudiation)?
* Attacker potential: Which attackers are expected (time and financial resources, technical capabilities)?
