#M 4.203 Configuration checklist for routers and switches
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In summary, the most important security-related settings on routers and switches can be checked using the following configuration checklist. However, it must be noted that the secure configuration of routers and switches is very dependent on the purpose. For example, on border routers, the setup of ACLs, anti-spoofing configuration, etc. must be considered. Therefore, the following table should be used as a general guide only. Security measures that apply to routers also apply to switches as long as they support routing features and to the extent these features are used.
