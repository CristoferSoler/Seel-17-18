#G 2.11 Insufficient road dimensioning
When planning networks, server rooms or data centers, it is often the case that the functional, capacitive or safety-related design is exclusively geared to current requirements. It is overlooked that

* the capacity of the network and the computers must be increased due to increasing data volumes or the use of new services and services,
* Changes in technical standards may result in structural or safety adjustments,
* Extensions of the network are often necessary due to changed operational requirements,
* new requirements for the network even make the laying of other cables required.




## Examples 
* An extension of networks is only possible to the extent permitted by the existing cables laid or the space available for additional cables. Especially in closed tracks (pipes, screed-covered floor panels) it is often not possible, despite the space still available, to pull in additional cables without damaging new and old cables. The only solution is to pull the existing cables out of the line and reconnect all the cables, the old and the new, at the same time. The resulting operating costs and costs are considerable.
