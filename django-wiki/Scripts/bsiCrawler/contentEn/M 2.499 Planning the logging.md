#M 2.499 Planning the logging
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

On many IT systems within an information network, security-relevant events are logged and thus larger amounts of log data are generated. These contain important information that can help to identify and locate hardware and software problems as well as resource bottlenecks. In addition, log data is also used to detect security issues and attacks in good time, thereby increasing the level of information security. In order to be able to log safely, an appropriate degree of planning in advance is necessary. Thus, a logging concept should be created and clarified, whether logging locally or centrally. In addition, administration, deployment, early warning and preservation of evidence must be regulated.



## Examples 
* Active network components (such as B.Router, switches),
* Operating systems,
* Applications and services (such as web server, mail server, file server),
* Security components in the network (such as firewall, proxy, IDS),
* Security components on hosts (such as security gateways, virus scanners),
* Physical access systems.
