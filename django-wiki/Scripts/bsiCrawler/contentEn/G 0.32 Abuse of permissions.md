An abusive use of entitlements exists when benefits that are legitimately or unlawfully acquired are used beyond the intended scope. The goal is often to gain personal benefits or harm an institution or specific individuals.

In quite a few cases, for historical, technical or other reasons, people have more or more access, access or access rights than they need for their work. These rights may be abused for attacks.



## Examples 
* The more finely granular the access rights are to information, the greater the care required to keep these authorizations up to date. Therefore, there is a risk that when granting access rights too little is differentiated between the different roles, thereby facilitating the misuse of the authorizations.
* Different applications store access permissions or passwords in system areas that other users can access. This could allow attackers to change permissions or read passwords.
* People with overprivileged permissions might be tempted to access foreign files, for example, to view a foreign email because certain information is urgently needed.
