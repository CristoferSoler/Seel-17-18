#M 2.165 Selection of a suitable cryptographic product
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

The spectrum of cryptographic applications is very broad, ranging from a simple file encryption program on a single-user PC to firewall computers with cryptographic functions to secure a local network and real-time hardware encryption of video conferencing. It is clear that recommendations for the selection of cryptographic products are generally valid for this breadth.

Before making a selection, the user should specify all requirements for the product. The selected product should cover user requirements to the highest possible degree.



## Examples 
* provide the required basic cryptographic services,
* possibly meet special requirements due to the environment of use (eg single-user / multi-user PC, LAN environment, WAN connection),
* have the required technical performance characteristics (eg throughput rates),
* have the required Sicherheitsfunktionalit ten, in particular, the cryptographic mechanisms used must have the required strength.
