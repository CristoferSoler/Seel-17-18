#G 3.78 Flying wiring
In meeting, event and training rooms often change both the user and the type of use. This sometimes changes the equipment and thus, of course, the wiring in such rooms. Depending on the location of the connection points in the room (sockets of the power supply and the data network), this can lead to cables being routed across the room, even across traffic routes. Such flying cables are not just tripping hazards for people. If anyone stays attached to it, it can also cause damage to IT equipment:

* In the simplest case, only one plug connection is disconnected and the corresponding connection is interrupted.
* Due to the sudden pull on the cable, however, the plug connection can be damaged or destroyed. In addition, however, especially with screwed plugs, the connected device can fall from the table to the floor and thereby be damaged.
