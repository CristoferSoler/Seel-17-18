#M 5.170 Secure communication connections when using OpenLDAP
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The communication between a slapd server and its communication partners should be encrypted in order to protect the exchanged information from unauthorized access or change. In this case, the communication partners can be clients and other servers, for example in the context of partitioning and replication.



## Examples 
* StartTLS is an LDAP extended operation defined inRFC2830, which LDAPv3 uses as the default mechanism to ensure transmission security. A TLS-secured transmission is established on an already existing LDAP connection, all communication is via port 389.
* With ldaps: //, however, the connection is already encrypted. The slapd server must wait for connections at an additional port, usually port 636 is used.
