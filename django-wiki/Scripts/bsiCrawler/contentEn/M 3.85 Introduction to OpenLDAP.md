#M 3.85 Introduction to OpenLDAP
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

OpenLDAP is a directory service based on the University of Michigan's LDAP project. The original project aimed to develop a Directory Access Protocol (DAP) equivalent from the directory service standard X.500. DAP was tailored to the OSI stack, while LDAP uses the TCP / IP stack as a lightweight DAP, which is a slimmer DAP. The adjective slim indicates that LDAP does not implement the full functionality of X.500 DAP. The University of Michigan also developed a server that can handle the protocol very well. In this context, it is spoken by an LDAP server, although LDAP actually means only one protocol. Such servers are designed as hierarchical databases to support the LDAP protocol particularly well and to efficiently store the data exchanged with the protocol.



## Examples 
* Backends that actually store data (eg, back-hdb to access the BerkeleyDB),
* Backends granting proxy access to other data stores (eg back-ldap for access to other directory services) and
* Backends that dynamically generate data (for example, back-monitor to display the current state of OpenLDAP).
