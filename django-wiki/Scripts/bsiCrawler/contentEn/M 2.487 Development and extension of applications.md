#M 2.487 Development and extension of applications
Responsible for initiation: Specialists, responsible for the individual applications

Responsible for implementation: developer, procurer, head of development, tester

Rules should be defined and adhered to for the efficient development of applications (including web applications). The aim is to avoid design or programming errors in the early phase of the development and enhancement process, or at least to recognize them early on.

The following points should therefore be considered when developing and extending applications.



## Examples 
* Is the application being developed according to a suitable process model?
* Are all phases covered in the development of applications by the process model and completely completed before commissioning?
* Are Programming Guidelines Specified for Application Development?
* Will future standards and attack techniques be considered when designing and developing application security mechanisms?
* Are the development, test and production systems separated during application development?
* Are penetration tests performed on the application that test the application logic?
* Are the penetration tests performed in applications based on a four-eye principle?
