#G 5.107 Transfer of data to third parties by the outsourcing service provider
Outsourcing service providers typically have multiple customers. It is therefore always possible that there are competitors among them. This is especially the case for large outsourcing service providers and those that cover special requirements areas such as security services. If an outsourcing partner processes the orders of two competing organizations at the same time, conflicts of interest can arise unless there is a strict separation of order processing (client capability of the outsourcing service provider).

In such situations, work results and lessons learned from project work by employees or subcontractors of the service provider may be intentionally made directly available to the competitor. As a rule, such damage can no longer be remedied, even if individual persons or the outsourcing service provider as a whole can later be held legally responsible.

If personal data is processed or stored by the service provider as part of the outsourcing project, then additional data protection considerations must also be taken into account. If, for example, customer information of a client is compromised and published, there is a risk that the relationship of trust between the client and his customer will be permanently disrupted.
