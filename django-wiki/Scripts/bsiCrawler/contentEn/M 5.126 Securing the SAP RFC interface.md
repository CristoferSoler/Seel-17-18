#M 5.126 Securing the SAP RFC interface
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The Remote Function Call (RFC) mechanism is the primary communication interface for system-to-system communication for the ABAP stack. The Java stack also supports RFC communication via the Java Connector (JCo).

Information on SAP documentation for RFC communication can be found in M 2.346 Using the SAP documentation.



## Examples 
* The restriction can only be made to function groups, since only the value RFC_TYPE = FUGR is supported.
* The check of parameter RFC_NAME, which contains the list of affected function groups, is limited to eighteen characters. The list can be entered longer, but only the first eighteen characters are checked.
