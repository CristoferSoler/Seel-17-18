#M 6.29 TK basic connection for emergency calls
Responsible for initiation: TK-Anlagenverantwortlicher

In the event of a total or partial failure of the PBX, no connections can be made via the trunk lines connected to this system. However, to be able to get help, it makes sense to set up a completely separate base connection or analogue telephone connection.
