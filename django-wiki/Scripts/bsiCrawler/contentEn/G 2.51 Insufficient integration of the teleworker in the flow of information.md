#G 2.51 Insufficient integration of the teleworker in the flow of information
Because teleworkers are not in the institution on a daily basis, but work predominantly at home, they have less opportunity to participate in the direct exchange of information with supervisors and work colleagues. There is a risk that they will be cut off from business activities, thereby reducing identification with the institution.

In addition, it can not be ruled out that information that is required due to a lack of information security information will not reach the teleworker adequately or in good time. For example, the short-term transmission of computer virus messages may be difficult.

Status: as of 2005
