#M 4.65 Testing new hardware and software
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

Before using new hardware components or new software in the production environment, these must be checked on special test systems. In addition to the performance of the product, it must be checked in particular that the use of new components has no negative effects on the current IT systems. Since malfunctioning can not be excluded before successful tests and because errors are provoked during tests, test systems that are isolated from the production operation must always be used.

The use of isolated test systems is also required to create self-extracting files that can be used, for example. received by e-mail, to check for malicious features.

General procedures for software acceptance and approval, including testing, are described in module B 1.10 Standard software. Only after passing the test can new components be released for installation on production systems.
