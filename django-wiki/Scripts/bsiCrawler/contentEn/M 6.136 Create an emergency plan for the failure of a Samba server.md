#M 6.136 Create an emergency plan for the failure of a Samba server
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

When creating a contingency plan for a Samba server, the first things to consider in M 6.96 are contingency considerations for a server. In addition, the following points must be taken into account:

* The installation sources (such as source code packages or binary packages) with which the Samba server was installed should be stored in a specified location (see also M 6.21 Backup copy of the software used).
* If the Samba service has been translated from source, then the documentation should include all the options used during compilation (especially the options that called the configure script).
* If the Samba service has been installed from a bin package, all steps should be documented to help you understand the installation.
* Any change to a configuration file, especially the smb.conf file, should be documented. It is recommended to use a version control. In addition, all configuration files must be backed up regularly. The M 6.135 Regular backup of important system components of a Samba server contains further information on this topic.
