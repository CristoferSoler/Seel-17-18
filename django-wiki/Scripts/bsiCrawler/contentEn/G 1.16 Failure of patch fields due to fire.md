#G 1.16 Failure of patch fields due to fire
Patch panels and line distributors, to which the internal lines of the household network and the external network of the public network accumulate, can be so severely damaged by a fire that a smooth data transfer over them is no longer possible. The damage is not caused solely by the heat of the fire. Even the smoke of fire can damage the sensitive connection technology massively. The use of extinguishing agents (water, powder, foam) leads to further damage.

After such a damage event, it is then generally no longer possible to simply connect available replacement hardware to such damaged patch panels or line distributors so as to be able to resume at least one emergency operation quickly.

In general, very extensive, costly and time-consuming repair work is required, which comes with a longer downtime.
