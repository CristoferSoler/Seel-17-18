#G 5.121 Attacks over TCP / IP on z / OS systems
In order to attack a z / OS system via the network connection, it is often not necessary to have specialized knowledge of the SNA network architecture or MVS. TCP / IP connectivity to public networks and Unix System Services make many z / OS systems available over standard protocols and services, such as: HTTP or FTP, accessible to external attackers.

External attackers may perform denial-of-service attacks against the services offered via the TCP / IP connection to public networks or may illegally read or manipulate transmitted data.

Internal attackers can use the TCP / IP connection to internal networks to try to increase their privileges, for example, by identifying the ID and password of a user with special rights.
