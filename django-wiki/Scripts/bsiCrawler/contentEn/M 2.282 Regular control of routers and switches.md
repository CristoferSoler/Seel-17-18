#M 2.282 Regular control of routers and switches
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

To ensure proper operation of the active network components and the correctness of all configuration parameters, a more regular, automated process of control should be established. These include, for example, regular functional tests, initiating changes and checking the implementation, and checking the log files and alarms.

In order to be able to effectively process the large amount of relevant data generated during operation, it is usually necessary to use suitable tools for as far as possible automated checking. This can be done, for example, by integration into a network management system (NMS).



## Examples 
* The general functionality of devices is normally checked regularly by the administrator during operation.
* The integrity of configuration files should be checked at regular intervals. The security policy for routers and switches should require a periodic review with responsibilities.
* The state of the data backup (centrally stored configuration files) should be checked regularly by the administrator.
* The system documentation should be constantly updated by the administrator. The actuality can be checked during audits.
