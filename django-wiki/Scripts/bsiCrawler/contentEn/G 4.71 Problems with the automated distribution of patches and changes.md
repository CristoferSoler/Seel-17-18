#G 4.71 Problems with the automated distribution of patches and changes
Frequently, patches and changes are not distributed manually, but centrally with software support. The use of software-based tools in the context of patch and change management, in addition to some advantages also associated with disadvantages. In the case of complex IT structures of an institution, individual errors in patching the IT systems can lead to massive security problems. This is especially serious when many systems simultaneously install software that contains security holes.

If only a few mistakes occur, they can often be remedied by hand. But it will be problematic if the IT system can not be reached permanently in the LAN. An example of this are sales representatives who rarely and irregularly connect their computers to the LAN. For example, if the tool is configured to distribute the updates within a certain time frame and not all IT systems are reachable, these IT systems can not be updated.
