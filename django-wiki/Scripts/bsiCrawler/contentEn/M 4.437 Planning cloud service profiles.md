Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Due to the high complexity, detailed planning for the provision of cloud services is indispensable. Therefore, an analysis of the necessary framework conditions must be carried out already in a conceptual analysis and in advance of a project.

Cloud service profiles are defined by a set of information that describes the cloud resources and their configuration. Cloud resources are CPU, memory, networks or storage systems / storage networks. The cloud service profiles must enable error-free automatic replication of cloud services.



## Examples 
* Are the security requirements for cloud services included and included in the planning of cloud services?
* Are roles and permissions for cloud services profiles clearly predefined?
* Are input validations and limits defined for the provision of cloud services?
* Are authentication and encryption of the access route planned for the cloud services and do they comply with the recognized rules of technology?
* Has a monitoring of the cloud services been considered in the planning?
* Have settings for network-based client separation via virtual networks, virtual firewalls, VLANs been taken into account when planning the cloud service profiles?
