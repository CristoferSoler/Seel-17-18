#G 2.200 Inadequate planning for the acquisition of mobile phones, smartphones, tablets or PDAs
Mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, and PDAs cause information security issues when

* relevant characteristics of the equipment to be acquired are not collected during the planning phase,
* the functional scope of the devices does not correspond to the intended use or
* Other boundary conditions for the safe operation of the devices were not taken into account.


Although the range of functions of mobile phones, smartphones, tablets and PDAs from different providers is very similar, at sometimes relevant points, such as the device management, there are great differences. So it can be that

* a smartphone can not be connected to the network of the institution in a desired manner (for example with IPSec),
* the device does not support full encryption of all stored data,
* If no self-created or customized applications can be used on the device, this should be necessary
* the e-mail client on the device only saves access passwords in plain text,
* the software used for the management of mobile devices is not compatible with the operating system version of the smartphone and therefore relevant requirements from the security concept (for example, forcing a long password) are not feasible or
* An employee works mainly outside closed areas and therefore instead of a standard smartphone needs a weather-resistant and shock-resistant device with longer battery capacity.


If these and similar aspects are not sufficiently taken into account in the planning phase, this could result in dangers to the information security of the institution.
