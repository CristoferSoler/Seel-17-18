#M 4.22 Prevent the confidentiality loss of sensitive data in the Unix system
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Unix commands such as ps, finger, who, last can be used to determine information about a user (eg work behavior). Many Unix derivatives also contain additional commands such as. listusers on Solaris. It should be considered whether the execution of these commands should be allowed for each user (privacy, login name extraction and the like). If in doubt, access to these commands should be restricted.

When calling up commands, no sensitive information may be entered as a parameter, such as eg. a password, since other users with ps can see this information.

The log files, such as wtmp, utmp, wtmpx, utmpx, etc., should be protected against unauthorized readout by suitable access rights if possible, since a large amount of information can be read out about the users.
