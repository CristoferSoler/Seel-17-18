#M 2.348 Security when customizing SAP systems
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

As part of customizing, an SAP system is configured and adapted so that it can offer the required support for the institution. This task is usually time consuming. The following is therefore to be considered:

* For customizing, a corresponding concept must be created that describes the desired target state of the SAP system as precisely as possible and also defines the processes by which customizing is performed.
* The concept requires a requirement analysis. It must be determined which adjustments must be made by customizing so that the required system behavior is achieved (see also M 2.341 Planning the SAP Deployment.
* As part of the customizing process, you need to use backflushes that allow the concept to be adapted during the conversion (see also M 4.258 Secure Configuration of the SAP ABAP Stack).
* The customizing may only be carried out by knowledgeable and trustworthy persons.
* Adjustments to the configurations should not be made in the productive system, but should be controlled via the transport system.
