#G 5.1 Manipulation or destruction of equipment or accessories
Outsiders, as well as inner-dwellers, can try to manipulate devices, accessories, documents and other data carriers for various reasons (revenge, benevolence, frustration) or to destroy. Attacks can be all the more effective the later they are discovered, the more comprehensive the abuser's knowledge is and the more profound the consequences for a job are. The manipulations range from unauthorized access to valuable data to the destruction of data carriers or IT systems. Significant downtime can be the result.

Example:

* Inside a company, an inside desk used its knowledge that a key server is sensitive to overheating, blocking the slots for the power adapter with a hidden object behind the server. Two days later, the hard disk in the server suffered a temperature-related defect and the server failed for several days. Afterwards, the attacker claimed that it had been a mistake.
* One employee had been so annoyed with the system's repeated shutdown that he was ranting out his anger at his workstation. He hit the computer several times and damaged the hard drive so badly that it was unusable. The IT department was only partially able to reconstruct the data stored there by backing up from the previous day.
