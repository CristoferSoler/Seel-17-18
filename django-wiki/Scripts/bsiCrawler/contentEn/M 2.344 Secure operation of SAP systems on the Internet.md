Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Head of Development, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: administrator, developer

SAP systems are increasingly being used in Internet scenarios. As a rule, corresponding additional applications are then installed, or they are used as back-end systems in the context of Internet portal scenarios (see also M 2.343 Securing an SAP System in the Portal Scenario). Access to Internet scenarios is usually via HTTP, and users use a browser for it.

Therefore, in Internet scenarios the following aspects have to be considered:



## Examples 
* It should be checked whether it is actually necessary for the data to be made available via direct access to the internal systems or whether periodic data exports and imports are possible. This prevents access to internal systems from outside.
* When exporting data, it should be checked whether all information needs to be exported, or whether only some of the information is actually needed. This limits the data stored on the SAP system with Internet access.
