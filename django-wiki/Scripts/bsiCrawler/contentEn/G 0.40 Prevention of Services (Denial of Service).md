#G 0.40 Prevention of Services (Denial of Service)
There are a variety of different forms of attack that aim to prevent the intended use of certain services, functions or devices. The generic term for such attacks is Denial of Service. Often the term DoS attack is also used.

Such attacks may include emaciated employees or customers, as well as competitors, blackmailers, or politically motivated agents. The target of the attacks can be business-relevant values ??of all kinds. Typical manifestations of DoS attacks are

* Disruption of business processes, eg. by flooding the order acceptance with faulty orders,
* Impairments of the infrastructure, eg. by blocking the doors of the institution,
* Inducing IT failures by z. B. Services of a server in the network targeted overloaded.


This type of attack is often associated with distributed resources, where an attacker harvests these resources to the point that they are no longer available to the actual users. For IT-based attacks, for example. The following resources can be artificially curtailed: processes, CPU time, memory, disk space, transmission capacity.
