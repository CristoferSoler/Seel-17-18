#M 3.4 Training before program use
Responsible for initiation: Supervisor, Head of Human Resources

Responsible for implementation: Specialists, supervisors

Improper use of IT applications can be avoided by providing users with in-depth guidance on IT applications. Therefore, it is imperative that users be adequately trained before taking on IT-supported tasks. This applies to the use of standard program packages as well as specially developed IT applications.

In addition, training measures must be carried out even in the event of extensive changes in an IT application.

If easily comprehensible manuals or help texts are available for IT applications, instead of the training, it may also be necessary to familiarize yourself with them on an independent basis. An essential prerequisite for this, however, is that the users have enough time for familiarization.
