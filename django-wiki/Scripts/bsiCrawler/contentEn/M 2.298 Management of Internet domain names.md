#M 2.298 Management of Internet domain names
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT

Internet domain names (domains) must be registered with registrars. A registrar may name one or more so-called top-level domains (for example, the classic domains .com, .org, .gov and the various country domains such as .de for Germany, .at for Austria and .ch for Switzerland). Domains are registered for a specific period of time. If this period has expired, the registration must be extended against payment of a fee. If the extension of a registration is forgotten, this can have unpleasant consequences (see G 2.100 Error in the application and administration of Internet domain names). It must therefore be ensured that registrations for all domains used by an organization are regularly and timely extended. For this purpose, a body should be defined in each organization, which coordinates the administration of the domain names at the various registration authorities.

In addition to the management of domain names and ensuring the timely extension of registrations, the following points should also be considered when managing Internet domain names:



## Examples 
* Is there a place that regularly and timely extends the registration for all domains used?
* Is Domain Grabbing Prevented?
