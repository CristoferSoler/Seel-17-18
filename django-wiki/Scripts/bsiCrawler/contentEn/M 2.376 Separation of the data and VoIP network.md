#M 2.376 Separation of the data and VoIP network
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Head of Domestic Engineering, Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: administrator, building services, IT manager

IP telephony allows telephoning over existing IP data networks. However, to increase scalability, quality of service (QoS), manageability and security, the data networks may also be logically separated from the voice networks. It must be checked whether a separation of data and VoIP network is required. A separation is useful if the data and VoIP network have different protection requirements.



## Examples 
* The VoIP components require access to user databases, such as LDAP directories, which are typically already on the data network, but might need to be maintained twice in the case of network separation.
* The administration of the VoIP network, such as the name resolution via DNS, usually requires access to the data network.
* The administration of the VoIP components can be more complicated if the networks are consistently separated, for example because software updates of the VoIP components can no longer be transmitted via a data network, for example viaSFTP, but must be recorded locally SEN. Even a remote configuration of VoIP components, for example via SSH or SHTTP, requires a connection to a data network or separate IT systems for configuration.
