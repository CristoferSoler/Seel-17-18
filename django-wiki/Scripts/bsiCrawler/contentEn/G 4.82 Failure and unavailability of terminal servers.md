#G 4.82 Failure and unavailability of terminal servers
In a classic client-server architecture, applications such as word processing are executed on the users' clients. If there is currently no contact with a required server, it is often possible to work asynchronously on the clients, depending on the application. For example, if the network fails, an opened document can also be stored on the file server at a later date. If a mail server is not available for a short time, the message is usually cached and delayed by the mail client. Under certain circumstances, such an incident is not noticed by the user at all.

In an environment with terminal servers, on the other hand, the applications are executed centrally and their output is transferred to the corresponding terminal. If the terminal server is unavailable, user input can no longer be processed and the applications provided by the server immediately fail. Obtain the clients, such as. For example, in a thin-client environment, the entire user interface, including the operating system, from the remote server, as seen from the user's perspective, completely fails the IT system.

Failures of the network or the terminal server usually not only affect individual users. In many cases, many or even all clients of the institution rely on the terminal server. If a terminal server fails, a large number of users will be affected simultaneously.
