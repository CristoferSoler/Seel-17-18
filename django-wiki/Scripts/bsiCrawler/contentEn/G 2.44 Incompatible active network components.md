#G 2.44 Incompatible active network components
If communication methods are used in a network that are not or not yet completely standardized, this can lead to incompatibilities between the network components used. The reason for this is that sometimes component manufacturers are forced to use proprietary implementations because of missing or only partially existing standards.

Incompatibility problems of this kind can arise, in particular, when existing networks are supplemented by active network components from other manufacturers or when networks with network components from different manufacturers are set up.

If active network components with different implementations of the same communication method are operated together in one network, the availability of individual subregions, the failure of certain services or even the entire network can be lost.
