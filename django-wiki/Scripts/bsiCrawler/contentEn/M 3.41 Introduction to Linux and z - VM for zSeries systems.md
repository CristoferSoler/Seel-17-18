#M 3.41 Introduction to Linux and z / VM for zSeries systems
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

In addition to the Unix System Services (USS) running under z / OS, Linux is also available for the zSeries hardware.

Linux for zSeries is the same as for other platforms, and kernel modifications are only for zSeries hardware (system environment, CPU architecture, and hardware-dependent drivers). Because the zSeries Linux port is a port, it works with the ASCII character set (as opposed to the USS HFS file system running in EBCDIC mode). There are currently two Linux versions available for this platform family: a 31 Bit version for S / 390 hardware and a 64 Bit version for zSeries hardware (the S / 390 system Although it is a 32  bit system, the software runs on it with 31 bits, since the first bit is required for switching between 24 Bit and 31 Bit mode).



## Examples 
* Linux Native on zSeries hardware
* Linux in a zSeries LPAR
* Linux under the carrier system z / VM
