#M 5.117 Integration of a database server in a security gateway
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

There are two main application cases when building database servers for access from an untrusted network:

Both cases are described in the following two sections:



## Examples 
* Access from the Internet is done exclusively via HTTP or HTTPS to the web server. The accesses are secured accordingly by the ALG.
* An application running on the web server translates the query into appropriate database queries, executes those queries on the database, and processes the results accordingly.
* The administration of the database computer, the database system and the maintenance of the data in the database takes place via appropriately secured connections from the internal network.
