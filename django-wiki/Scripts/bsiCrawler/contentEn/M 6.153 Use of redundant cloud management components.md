#M 6.153 Use of redundant cloud management components
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

Since the failure of a cloud management solution can usually affect a larger number of cloud users, the cloud management components (in particular the cloud management server and its management software) should be redundant, so that if one server fails whose tasks can be taken over by one or more other servers. Redundant systems can be maintained both physically and virtually. In order to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the redundant systems, the swing to the replacement environment should be tested regularly (eg annually).

Regardless of the type of redundancy, the provisioning facilities of cloud management systems should be planned and implemented fail-safe. These include, in particular, power supply and air conditioning.



## Examples 
* Are the cloud management components redundant?
* Are the utilities (power supply, air conditioning) fail-safe?
* Is the pan tested regularly for the replacement environment?
