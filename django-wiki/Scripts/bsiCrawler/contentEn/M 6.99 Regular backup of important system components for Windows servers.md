#M 6.99 Regular backup of important system components for Windows servers
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Responsible for data protection

The system components of a Windows server are to be backed up regularly, as the server is subject to constant configuration changes, depending on its server role. Unintentional changes that can provoke errors in the system, such as incorrect application updates, may require the recovery of critical system components. Important system components are not just the actual system files, but also configuration data, such as registry, IIS metabase, status information, DHCP databases, WINS, and historical data. The backup can be performed by a backup program or selectively via the file system, for example by script. In general, at least status information and log data must be backed up with the Windows Server backup or a suitable third-party program daily within the framework of the specifications of a data protection concept (see B 1.4 Data backup concept).
