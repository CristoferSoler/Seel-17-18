#G 5.81 Unauthorized use of a crypto module
If a third party succeeds in using a crypto module unauthorized, the result can be various kinds of damage. Examples of such damage are:

* In the case of unauthorized use, the attacker succeeds in reading out secret keys, changing keys or even manipulating critical security parameters. The result would be that the cryptographic methods no longer offer sufficient security.
* In the case of unauthorized use, the attacker manipulates the crypto module in such a way that, although it works correctly at first glance, it is actually in an insecure state.
* The attacker uses the crypto module in the form of a masquerade. If he signs or encrypts data during the unauthorized use of the crypto module, this is interpreted by the recipient of the data as if the authorized user had done so.




## Examples 
* An unauthorized use of a crypto module is possible if the regular user leaves his or her workplace at short notice and the functional crypto module can be used without being protected against unauthorized access, that is, for example, if a signature or Encryption smart card gets stuck in the computer. This allows anyone who happens to pass by signing e-mail on behalf of the regular user or encrypting files stored on the IT system so that the user can no longer use them.
