#M 5.61 Suitable physical segmentation
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

Physical segmentation is the process of segmentation using network components at layer 1, 2, or 3 of the OSI reference model. Appropriate physical segmentation can be used to select the required security measures in the subnetworks according to the respective protection requirements for availability, integrity and confidentiality, if corresponding network components (see M 5.13 Appropriate Use of Elements for Network Coupling) be used suitably. An appropriate tailoring of network security makes it easier to implement and maintain the required security measures.

Therefore, when designing or making fundamental changes to a local network, care must be taken to ensure appropriate physical segmentation.



## Examples 
* Changes to network components (relocation, installation of new, unauthorized component etc.) are prevented or at least detected (hardware-related security),
* Changes to the configuration of the network components (eg to routing protocols, to the port switching matrix or to the VLAN assignment) are prevented or at least detected (software-related security).
