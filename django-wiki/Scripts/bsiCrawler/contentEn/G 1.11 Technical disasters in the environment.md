#G 1.11 Technical disasters in the environment
Problems in the environment of a company's business can lead to difficulties in the company and even to workouts. These can be technical accidents, disasters, but also social or political unrest such as demonstrations or riots (see also G 1.12 Impaired by major events).

The real estate of an organization may be exposed to various environmental hazards through traffic (roads, rail, air, water), neighboring businesses or residential areas. These can be caused, for example, by fire, explosions, dust, gases, blockages, radiation, emissions (chemical industry).

Preventive or rescue measures can directly affect the properties. Due to the complexity of building services and IT facilities, indirect problems can also arise.
