#G 1.17 Failure or malfunction of a radio network
In radio networks, information is transmitted by electromagnetic radio waves. If other electromagnetic sources emit energy in the same frequency spectrum, they may interfere with the wireless communication and in extreme cases prevent the operation of the WLAN. This may be inadvertently caused by other technical systems (eg Bluetooth devices, other WLANs, microwave ovens, medical devices, wireless surveillance cameras, etc.) or by deliberate operation of a source of interference (jamming). as a so-called denial of service attack done. In addition, denial-of-service attacks are possible, for example. by repeatedly transmitting certain control and management signals which may result in loss of availability of the radio network.



## Examples 
* In the case of an unsuitable mounting position for an external antenna and poorly planned lightning and weather protection, a WLAN may be damaged by lightning or weathering.
* For WLAN systems that operate in the 2.4 GHz band according to the IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g standard, interference can be caused by a large number of other radio systems approved in this frequency band, such as Bluetooth, microwave ovens or others Wi-Fi networks are caused.
