Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

When installing an SAP system, the following aspects must be taken into consideration, as important steps are taken to ensure its safety during the installation phase.



## Examples 
* Are the IT systems hardened during the installation of the SAP system, meaning that unnecessary services and programs are deactivated or removed?
* Is the possibly unneeded stack part protected against unauthorized use during the installation of the SAP system?
* Is the password selection during SAP installation based on the internal password specifications?
* Are new passwords entered during the SAP installation even if the installation routine already specifies a password?
* Are the passwords assigned during the SAP installation changed by trustworthy administrators?
* Are the SAP installation sources secured so that only authorized administrators can access them?
* Are the installation instructions for the SAP installation taken into consideration before and during installation?
* Is the secure installation and configuration of the affected SAP and non-SAP components according to the planning?
