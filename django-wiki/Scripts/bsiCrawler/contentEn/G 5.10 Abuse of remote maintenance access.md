#G 5.10 Abuse of remote maintenance access
Remote maintenance access enables access to IT systems from outside. In the case of insufficiently secured remote maintenance access, it is conceivable that unauthorized persons gain access to these IT systems unnoticed, even with administrative authorizations if necessary. For example, after overcoming authentication mechanisms such as password entry, attackers could perform all administrative activities. In the event of a complete breakdown of the equipment, serious operational problems, data lost or even the loss of confidentiality of all data stored on the affected IT system, there may be the risk of serious financial loss.



## Examples 
* To propagate system errors to the manufacturer, the Remote Support Facility (RSF) is generally used in large processors with the z / OS operating system. RSF can also be used to make patches on the so-called microcode by the manufacturer. Misusing the RSF access of z / OS systems therefore poses a significant threat.
* Because the password policy was poorly enforced or because the password policy was too weak, the password for a maintenance PC of a TC system could be determined by systematic trial and error (through a dictionary attack). After overcoming the system password, the attacker was able to administer the TC system according to his own ideas.
