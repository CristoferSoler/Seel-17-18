#G 1.13 Storm
The effects of a storm or hurricane on outdoor facilities that are indirectly needed to run a data center are often underestimated. External equipment may be damaged or torn off as a result. Demolished and thrown by the storm objects can cause further consequential damage. Furthermore, technical components can be impaired in their function.



## Examples 
* The data center air conditioning ducts were laid on the roof as flexible rigid PVC hoses, but were neither weighted nor fastened over long distances on the roof. They were seized by the hurricane and swept from the roof of the building. They tore out of the connections. The cooling liquid ran out and the system had to be shut down for several hours. For the duration of the storm, no repairs could be made because of the danger of being blown off the roof. The server park was shut down for almost 12 hours. He supplies about 12,000 users.
