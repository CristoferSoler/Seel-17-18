#G 5.196 Preventing Information and Service Synchronization in a Distributed SOA Environment
In a distributed SOA environment, for example in a mobile environment, the individual service providers are designed to be redundantly redundant in order to increase their availability. For the consistency of services and information, it is necessary that the service providers synchronize with each other periodically or event-related.

An attacker who has knowledge of the information structure can prevent a targeted attack on critical communication links or prevent the service providers from synchronizing on time.
