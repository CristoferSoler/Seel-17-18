#G 2.127 Insufficient planning of data protection methods for domain controllers
If incorrect data backup methods are used to secure domain controllers in an Active Directory, this may affect operations within the affected domain. Therefore, the following problems may arise if the special status, as well as the technical conditions of Dom nen controllers are not taken into account in the data backup:

By using incompatible software for data protection of the domain controllers, unnecessary replication can be triggered on the affected systems and, at the same time, disruptions of the Active Directory (see G.4.46 Effective file replication).

In addition, if the backup methods are not planned, it is not ensured that the permissions of the backup operators for the member servers of the domain are set sufficiently restrictive. If the rights are set insufficiently or unrestrictedly, the backup operators may be able to obtain administrative authorizations for the domains and, as a result, role models may be undermined.

In particular, for multi-site organizations, a lack of data backup scheduling may result in branch offices being ignored, or any remote backup solutions that may be selected may not provide sufficient protection for the data being backed up, and therefore security-related Active Directory data can be read during the transmission.

If the interval between two data backups is chosen too large, when restoring a domain controller, active directory objects marked for deletion may already be imported whose lifetime has already been exceeded. This can lead to problems with the replication between domain controllers and thus to inconsistencies.
