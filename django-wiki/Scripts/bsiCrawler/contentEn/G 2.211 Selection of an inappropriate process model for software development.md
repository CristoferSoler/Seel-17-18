#G 2.211 Selection of an inappropriate process model for software development
Process models structure and plan the project flow by specifying specific steps and their sequence. If an unsuitable process model for the software development procedure is selected, the course of the project can be significantly influenced. Depending on the selected model and scope of the project, either important aspects are neglected or irrelevant aspects are over-focused. Both mentioned problems increase the workload in the project management and limit the productive work.

If the chosen process model is too rigid, subsequent changes can only be made with great effort, as they were not taken into account in the previous planning.

If the model is too flexible, the software development process can be delayed by excessive number of iterations that result from inadequately detailed preplanning or repetitive change requests.

Likewise, the personnel expenses for the realization of a project can be wrongly protected if an inappropriate procedure model is used.



## Examples 
* The waterfall model describes a linear course of software development and does not provide for another iteration of this phase after completion of a phase. If the procedure according to the waterfall model is strictly adhered to, for example, in the implementation phase, subsequently changed requirements that would be useful for improving safety can no longer be taken into account.
