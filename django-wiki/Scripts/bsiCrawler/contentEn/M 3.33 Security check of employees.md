#M 3.33 Security check of employees
Responsible for initiation: IT Security Officer, Head of Human Resources

Responsible for implementation: Human Resources, Supervisors

The possibilities of having the trustworthiness of new or third-party personnel checked are legally very limited in Germany, but also in many other countries. In addition, the results are usually less meaningful, such as. for police certificates. In principle, however, projects should be checked before accepting new or external employees

* these have sufficient references, z. B. from other, similar projects, and
* the CV submitted by the candidate is informative and complete.


In addition, it may be useful to have academic and professional qualifications confirmed, such as inquiries at the university or previous employers or clients. The identity of the applicant should also be verified, eg. by presentation of identification documents.

If external personnel are used internally or if internal applications and data can be accessed through projects, cooperations or outsourcing projects, comparable reviews should be carried out as for own employees. When drafting contracts with external service providers, it should be contractually stipulated which side has to carry out such checks and to what extent these are carried out.
