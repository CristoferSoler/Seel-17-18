#M 5.46 Use of stand-alone systems for the use of the Internet
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to reduce the dangers that result from attacks from the Internet on local data or computers in the LAN, it makes sense to use computers that are only networked to the Internet and have no further network connection to a LAN.

For this the different operating systems offer different possibilities with specific dangers for the confidentiality and integrity of the data on this computer.

More detailed descriptions of how stand-alone systems can be safely used for the Internet can be found in the module B 3.208 Internet PC.
