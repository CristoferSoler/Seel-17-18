#G 3.71 Bad system time on z / OS systems
The system time (date and time) is an important factor for a whole range of applications and system programs, depending on the correct execution of a large number of actions and the reliable production of results and data is.

Incorrect date / time information may cause, among other things, the following security issues and resulting damages:

* Applications that make decisions based on the current date will return erroneous results. The reworking of whole day productions can be the result. This applies in particular to online applications and their transaction data. Corrections are often no longer possible if z. B.Customers access the system online.
* Analyzing security incidents that take time data into account can be significantly more difficult or lead to erroneous results.
* Differing system times in interconnected systems are problematic when z. B. log data are used for a common evaluation.
* Applications that receive data from multiple individual systems and process them based on timestamps will yield incorrect results.
