#G 5.34 Intentionally reprogramming the destination keys of a fax machine
To avoid having to frequently re-enter frequently recurring recipient fax numbers, some fax machines offer programmable destination number keys. Frequently the recipient numbers are not even checked when sending the fax. If an unauthorized person can change the programming of the destination keys and then causes the incoming faxes at the new destination address to be forwarded to the authorized recipient as soon as possible, he can easily follow the fax traffic to this recipient , possibly without ever being discovered.
