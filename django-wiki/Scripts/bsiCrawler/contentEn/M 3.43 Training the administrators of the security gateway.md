#M 3.43 Training the administrators of the security gateway
Responsible for initiation: Public authority / management, IT security officer

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer, IT manager

A security gateway is a key element in securing a network against outside threats. Therefore, it is imperative that the security gateway administrators are sufficiently trained to be able to optimally provide all the features and security features they need to use.

The training should provide sufficient knowledge of the procedures, tools, and techniques required to set up and operate the security gateway components. This also applies to vendor-specific aspects of individual products that are used as components of the security gateway. For the training requirements for operating systems of computers, which are used as components of the security gateway and for active network components (especially routers that are part of a security gateway as packet filters), the information in the respective blocks of the operating system or in block B 3.302 Routers and Switches are taken into account.

In general, training should include the following elements:

* Basics and concepts of administration, knowledge of commands for setup, operation, maintenance and troubleshooting for each component of the security gateway. Training should be a balanced mix of theory and practice.
* Basics of information security, in particular precautionary measures, reaction, analysis and incident handling (see, for example, module B 1.8 Handling of security incidents)
* Attack scenarios (eg denial of service attacks, ARP spoofing, IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, viruses and other malware)
* Basics of structuring networks
* ISO / OSI layers model
* Basics of IP and its related protocols (IP addressing, subnetting, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP) and the various filtering options based on the header data
* Basics of routing, static and dynamic routing, fundamentals of the routing protocols used and their security aspects
* Basics of the most important application layer protocols used (for example, SMTP, HTTP and HTTPS, secure shell, SMB / CIFS) and the various filtering options based on protocol commands or command parameters
* Fundamentals of Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
* Intrusion Detection / Intrusion Prevention Basics (IDS / IPS)
* Basics for handling encrypted data (encryption eg with HTTPS or IPSec) and options for handling encrypted data
* OperationManagement of the devices, toolslogging backup and administration of configuration data
* TroubleshootingSources of errors and causesMeasuring and analysis tools, tools for automatic checking of the individual components of the security gateway for correct functionTest strategies for troubleshooting requirements for secure network installations
* Relevant legal aspects such as data protection, legal aspects of the network connection (in Germany for example Teledienstegesetz) and similar regulations


Even if the tasks are distributed in a group of administrators so that each administrator has only one specific area of ??responsibility, it is essential that all administrators have a general basic knowledge. Based on this, the individual focal points can be purposefully expanded and maintained. For many products there is an extensive offer of manufacturers and specialized suppliers for this purpose on building on each other and individually deepening seminars. The supply of qualified training is also a criterion that should be taken into account when deciding on a particular manufacturer.

For training, a budget should already be provided for the procurement of IT components and a training plan should be prepared for administrators.
