#M 2.89 Uninstalling standard software
Responsible for initiation: Head of IT

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

When uninstalling software, all files created for the operation of the software on the IT system and all entries in system files made with regard to the product must be deleted become. Many software products create files or modify existing files in various directories on the IT system during installation. Often, the user is not even informed about all changes made to the IT system during the installation.

Therefore, to perform a complete uninstall, it is helpful to keep track of the system changes made during installation, either manually or with the help of specialized tools. If this is not done, experience shows that deinstallation is rudimentary or that it is omitted for fear of deleting important files during uninstallation.
