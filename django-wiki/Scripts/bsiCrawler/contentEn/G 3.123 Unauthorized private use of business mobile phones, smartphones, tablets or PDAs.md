If a business mobile phone, smartphone, tablet or PDA is allowed privately, this may cause the following problems. Examples are:

* Private calls or use of data services incur costs for the institution.
* If the user uses a graphically complex application (eg a game), the battery drains faster. As a result, the device may no longer be available for subsequent official use.
* If the institution does not explicitly prohibit the private use of mobile phones, smartphones, tablets and PDAs, or if such prohibition is not effectively enforced, it may be. B. Data protection legal consequences, which can hinder the information security management system of the institution.
* If private personal data is stored on the device, there is a risk that the institution will violate data protection laws, for example if the data is automatically secured by the telephone by the institution.
* Installing and operating a private and non-Institutionalized application on a business mobile phone, smartphone, tablet or PDA may result in malicious software accessing the device. For example, the business telephone directory may leak to unauthorized persons or the integrity of the data on the device may be impaired by errors in the application.
