#G 5.192 Pre-fuming of wrong caller telephone numbers or SMS sender
Currently, with a relatively low cost, a called party can be provided with a false telephone number of the caller (Caller ID spoofing) or of the SMS sender (SMS ID spoofing). Attackers can pretend to an employee on a business trip a call from their own institution or a customer to get to confidential information. Even a short message from a known sender is more familiar and opened a possible appendix with malicious software frivolous.



## Examples 
* For the iPhone, there has been a SpoofApp for some time, with which callers can freely dial the phone number that is displayed to the called party. For example, the employee on a business trip receives a call from the alleged authorized officer of his company, who would like to quickly know the size of a tender that has just been submitted. He issues the numbers and the attacker sells the information to a competitor who undercuts the price.
* With SMS spoofing it is possible to show a name to the recipient instead of the phone number. For example, an attacker can prevent the head of a large company from traveling to an important meeting. All he has to do is text a text message from the boss's airline to show that the flight has been canceled.
