#G 2.110 Poor organization when changing versions and migrating databases
All organizational steps before and during a database change system (DBMS) or database migration are documented in migration and version concepts. The lack of such concepts can significantly impact task completion when problems occur during a database migration or DBMS upgrade and the DBMS or individual databases are unavailable.

If no secure fallback positions are specified in addition to the planning of the physical and semantic data migration, the workability of the DBMS database or database can be jeopardized for users and applications.

In the case of a DBMS version change, the databases stored in the DBMS remain unchanged. Security problems can arise less in the database itself than in the interaction of the databases with the new DBMS.



## Examples 
* A database upgrade changed basic definitions in the types.
* Access authorizations for user groups provided by the DBMS by default have been changed, thus affecting the rights of the user groups derived from them.
