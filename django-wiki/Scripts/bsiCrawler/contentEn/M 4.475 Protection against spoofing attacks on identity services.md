#M 4.475 Protection against spoofing attacks on identity services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: users

To prevent spoofing of identity services, a user should only call the services they can trust. This can be recognizable for him, for example, on the valid certificate for the respective service or be ensured by the automatic proof of a given identity (service authentication). The user should critically examine the trusted features provided with each service access.
