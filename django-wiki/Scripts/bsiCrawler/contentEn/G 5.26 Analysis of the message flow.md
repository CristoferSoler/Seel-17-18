#G 5.26 Analysis of the message flow
Using a traffic flow analysis, an attacker tries to get information about who sent which data to whom and when, and how often. Even if the eavesdropper can not read the message content, conclusions can be drawn on user behavior. The information about the date and time of the creation of a message can be evaluated to a personality profile of the sender. In addition, address collectors research for address publishers for e-mail and postal addresses in order to send unsolicited advertising.

Within the ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), the D channel of a communication connection, which serves to signal between the terminal and the exchange, would be a suitable point of attack. The analysis of the signaling transmitted there by means of a protocol analyzer does not just allow the above. Conclusion on user behavior (eg who is on the phone with whom and how long?), But can also be used to prepare more complex attacks over the D channel.
