#G 4.9 Failure of the internal power supply
The use of a mobile IT system, eg. of a laptop, assumes that the system has a power supply independent of the supply network. This power supply, usually designed with rechargeable batteries, usually lasts for several hours. After this time, the sufficient power supply is no longer secure, so that the IT system must be taken out of service or connected to the mains. The vast majority of mobile systems continuously monitor the supply voltage and indicate a critical voltage drop. If this display is ignored, it can happen that the system suddenly fails its service and the last work results in the main memory are lost.
