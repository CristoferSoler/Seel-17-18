#M 2.239 Planning the use of Novell eDirectory on the intranet
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

eDirectory is suitable as a management product for an organization's IT resources. For this purpose, the organizational hierarchy is mapped to an eDirectory tree and the access to the objects held in the directory is assigned accordingly. Automations, such as the inheritance of access permissions to subdomains and the setting up of user groups (organizational roles), can facilitate the administration of the directory system.

eDirectory can be run on different server platforms: Netware, Windows NT / 2000, Linux and Sun Solaris.

In addition to the LDAP access to the eDirectory, which is possible in principle for all applications, Novell offers special client software that enables resource and user management in eDirectory for specific systems. It refers to

* the Novell Client for Windows (currently - February 2002 - version 4.83 for Windows NT / 2000 / XP and version 3.31 for Windows 95/98 / ME),
* the Novell User Account Management Software for Solaris and Linux on Intel platform.


EDirectory can also be used to authenticate Netware servers and to control access to volumes held there.

The following aspects must be planned when setting up an eDirectory directory service on the intranet:

* the directory tree and illustration of IT resources in it,
* the object classes to be used as well as their attributes,
* if necessary planning a schema change,
* the establishment of users and user groups (see M 2.30 Rules for the Configuration of Users / User Groups),
* the connection of users to eDirectory (see M 4.157 Setting up access rights to Novell eDirectory),
* the access rights of users to the eDirectory (see S 4.157 Setting up access rights to Novell eDirectory),
* the administration concept for eDirectory (see M 3.29 Novell eDirectory Administration tutorial),
* partitioning and replication (see M .2.237 Partitioning and Replication Planning in Novell eDirectory),
* the certificate service (see M 4.155 Secure Configuration of Novell eDirectory),
* the client connection to the eDirectory (see M 4.156 Secure Configuration of the Novell eDirectory Client Software),
* the LDAP access to eDirectory by network applications (see M 4.158 Setting up LDAP access to Novell eDirectory),
* the encryption of traffic,
* data synchronization with foreign directory services using DirXML,
* the use of the Service Location Protocol (SLP),
* Audits (see M 4.160 Monitoring Novell eDirectory),
* an automated and logged periodic backup (see also M 6.81 Creating Backups for Novell eDirectory),
* the emergency provision for the system failure (see also M 6.106 Creation of an emergency plan for the failure of a directory service).
