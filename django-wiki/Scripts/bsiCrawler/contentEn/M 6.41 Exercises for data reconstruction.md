#M 6.41 Exercises for data reconstruction
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Responsible for data protection

The reconstruction of data using backup files must be tested sporadically, but at least after each change to the backup process. At least once it must be proven that a complete data reconstruction (eg the total data stock of a server) is possible. In this way it can be reliably determined whether

* data reconstruction is possible at all,
* the procedure of data backup is practicable,
* sufficient documentation of the data backup is available so that, if necessary, a representative can perform the data reconstruction and
* the time required for data reconstruction meets the requirements for availability.


Exercises for data reconstruction should also take into account that

* if necessary, the data must be installed on an alternate IT system and
* for data backup and data reconstruction different read / write devices are used.
