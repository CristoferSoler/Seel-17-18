#M 2.238 Define a security policy for Novell eDirectory
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator, IT Manager

As one of the main organizational tasks in the planning of eDirectory deployment, a security policy must first be fixed. The security policy determines which security policies should apply in an eDirectory system and how they must be enforced during installation.

The eDirectory security policy should govern all security-related topics in an eDirectory directory service. The following list gives a rough overview of the areas that should be regulated by such a directive. The list must be adapted, designed and expanded according to the application scenarios in the office or in the company.



## Examples 
* How should eDirectory servers be physically secured?
* Which eDirectory components, eg. B. ConsoleOne and iMonitor, should be used?
* Which tree structure should be chosen?
* How is this tree structure partitioned?
* Are schema changes made?
* Which object classes with which attribute values ??are used?
* Which replicas of which type should be created?
* Which computers are eDirectory servers and which computers hold a replica?
