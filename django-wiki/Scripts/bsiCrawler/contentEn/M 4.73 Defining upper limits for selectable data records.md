#M 4.73 Defining upper limits for selectable data records
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: administrator, application developer

In order to better control access to a database system and to improve performance, upper limits should be set for certain parameters of database systems.

In addition, this action may reduce the likelihood of certain types of denial-of-service attacks (see  5.65 Preventing Database Services).

Examples are:

* the setting of upper limits for data records that can be selected as part of a data access
* the maximum number of logins per user ID
* the maximum amount of CPU time per logon
* the total duration of a database connection
* the maximum allowable inactive time during a logon


The following notes should be noted in particular:



## Examples 
* SESSIONS PER USER 2,
* CPU _PER_SESSION 6000,
* IDLE_TIME 30,
* CONNECT_TIME 500;
