#G 2.130 Suitable selection of VPN encryption methods
The importance of a suitable VPN encryption method increases with the data throughput in the VPN, but also with the protection demand of the processed information. If an inappropriate encryption method has been selected, valuable information is exposed to many dangers when transmitting over unsafe networks.

In particular, static cryptographic keys and pre-shared keys (previously agreed keys or short PSK) are vulnerable to attack by means of cryptanalysis. Further, choosing a PSK can have an impact on security, such as dictionary and brute force attacks.

If an authentication component fails, poor emergency planning (eg missing redundancy) can lead to sensitive operating problems if users can not log on and use the VPN.



## Examples 
* The use of static cryptographic keys has major security disadvantages. Since the keys often remain unchanged for long periods of time, in many cases large amounts of data are encrypted. This greatly facilitates cryptanalysis of the encrypted data while increasing the usefulness of its results.
* In a business, a single PSK is used for the entire VPN infrastructure. In the case of a compromise, this leads to a considerable impairment of safety.
