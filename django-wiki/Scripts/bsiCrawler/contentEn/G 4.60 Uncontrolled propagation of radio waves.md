#G 4.60 Uncontrolled propagation of radio waves
Radio networks or the transmitted radio waves often exceed the limits of the self-used premises, so that data is transferred even in areas that can not be controlled and secured by the user or an institution. A record is thus possible without much effort and the discovery of such eavesdropping attacks will only occur in a fraction of the cases. The goal of such attacks can be to gain or manipulate sensitive information. Even if the data is encrypted, it often suffices to record and evaluate the radio traffic for a while, due to the inadequate protection of many wireless networks, in order to then be able to calculate the cryptographic keys with the collected data and thus decode the transmitted data. Through the use of directional antennas, data could also be received and monitored outside the actual useful range of the radio network.
