#G 2.212 Insufficient consideration of configuration options in software development
If dynamic configuration options are not taken into account during software development, problems may arise in productive operation because the software is not adaptable to changing operating conditions.

If the software is too heavily aligned with the development system, there is a possibility that it will no longer be compatible with the productive system because, for example, different access data are needed there for a database, but this information in the source code the software was hard-coded. If configuration options for adapting to different system requirements are lacking, the use of the software is hindered or prevented.

If references to system files are integrated as fixed paths in the source code, incompatibilities may occur if the software is run on a different computer.

Are storage locations for dynamically growing data volumes, e.g. Log files that are set by the software and can not be freely selected by the user may result in a shortage of storage space.



## Examples 
* The source code of an application contains fixed paths that reference Windows system files. Therefore, the application can not be run with other versions of Windows.
* In an application, the location for log data can not be user-configured. As a result, while the application is running, there are regularly bottlenecks in the available storage space.
