#G 5.155 Exploit dynamic DNS updates
Dynamic updates are used to automatically modify, add, or delete domain namespace data. Especially in the context of DHCP, dynamic updates play an important role. If an IP address is assigned to a host by the DHCP server, this information must also be entered in the domain namespace. This usually happens via dynamic updates.

However, there is a risk of misuse of dynamic updates. Domain information is changed automatically, so the security is based on the trustworthiness of those computers that can make dynamic updates and on the rules that define what can be modified. If dynamic updates are accepted from any source, any host can change domain information to their liking. An attacker can thus manipulate all services that require DNS. Furthermore, a combination with attacks such as phishing, malware infection, etc. is very likely.



## Examples 
* An attacker learned that a company's DNS servers unconditionally accept dynamic updates due to a configuration error. The attacker takes advantage of this and manipulates the domain information so that all the company's e-mail traffic is routed through its mail server. The attacker thus receives business-critical information that he sells to the competitors of the attacked company. Furthermore, he manipulates the domain information so that any connection to the company's intranet and web server is redirected to the attacker's web server. There is an attempt to infect the computer with malware and integrate into the bot network of the attacker. Thereafter, a forwarding to the originally desired intranet or web server takes place in order to remain undetected. Thus, not only company-internal, but also computers, which want to access from outside of the Web server, were compromised.
