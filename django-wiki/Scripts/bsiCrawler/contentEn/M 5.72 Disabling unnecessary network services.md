#M 5.72 Disabling unnecessary network services
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In order to deactivate all unused network services on a Unix system, proceed as follows:

There are two ways to start network services on Unix: through the server service inetd, which is configured in the /etc/inetd.conf file, and the startup files located in / etc / rc .d / init.d or /etc/init.d. To switch off unnecessary services in the file /etc/inetd.conf, the respective line must be commented out with #. In a default installation, more services are usually configured than necessary. Among them are always services that can pose a threat. Therefore, as few services as possible should be enabled, ie only those services which are indispensable on the respective system (see also M 4.95 Minimum Operating System and M 4.97 One Service per Server).

The services initiated by the startup files are referenced via links from the subdirectories /etc/rcX.d or /etc/rc.d/rcX.d, where X is the respective Unix runlevel, in which the startup file is called. To disable the unnecessary services, the unnecessary services can be moved to a subdirectory so that they can be re-enabled as needed. This can z. B. look like this:

cd rc3.d; mkdir .s; mv S85sendmail .s /

The currently active services can be identified with the netstat -a command.
