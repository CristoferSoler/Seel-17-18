#M 4.388 Secure authentication against OpenLDAP
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

To use OpenLDAP, it is usually necessary for the directory service to associate a session with a user's identity. Only then can the directory service be used meaningfully. For example, manage operating system resources, and only then will the specified access rights take effect (see M 4.387 Assigning access privileges to OpenLDAP). As part of the bind to the slapd server, therefore, the identity of the user is specified. If this is not done, anonymous access (anonymus) is used. If the identity is specified in the context of the bind, the user should prove that he actually has the identity he claims. If such a proof is not necessary, each user can log on with any identity, it is then an unauthenticated (unauthenticated).



## Examples 
* Is it ensured that the authentication on the OpenLDAP directory service takes place exclusively via encrypted connections?
* Are OpenLDAP passwords stored only as hash values ??and is a suitable hashing algorithm used?
