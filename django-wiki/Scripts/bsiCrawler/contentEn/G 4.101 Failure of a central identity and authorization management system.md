#G 4.101 Failure of a central identity and authorization management system
In a central identity and authorization management system, the identities of all authorized users are collected and the respective authorizations for institution-wide information processing are managed.

When the central identity and authorization management system completes, user profiles can no longer be changed, deleted or created. In the medium term, the linked processes and applications may no longer be usable because the authorizations can no longer be updated.

If the logins to IT components or applications are processed centrally, the entire institution-wide information technology can no longer be used in the event of a failure of the identity and authorization management system because the users can no longer log on. This can mean that the core processes of the institution no longer work.

Example:

* The central identity and entitlement management system of a company fails due to a denial of service attack. The employees are thus denied access to the files stored centrally on a server because the system can no longer authenticate them.
