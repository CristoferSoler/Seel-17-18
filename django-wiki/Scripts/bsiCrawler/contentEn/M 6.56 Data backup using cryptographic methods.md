#M 6.56 Data backup using cryptographic methods
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: IT security officer

When using cryptographic methods, the question of data backup must not be neglected. In addition to the question of how sensibly a data backup of the encrypted data should take place, it must also be considered whether and how the used cryptographic keys are to be stored. In addition, it is still expedient to secure the configuration data of the cryptoproducts used.



## Examples 
* the storage for transport purposes on a portable data carrier, eg. Eg floppy disk, chip card (mainly used for key distribution or key exchange, see M 2.46 Appropriate key management),
* the storage in IT components, which must access cryptographic keys permanently, thus z. B. for communication encryption and
* the deposit of keys as a prevention against the loss of keys or in the context of representation arrangements.
