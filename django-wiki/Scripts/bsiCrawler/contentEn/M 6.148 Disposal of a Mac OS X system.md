#M 6.148 Disposal of a Mac OS X system
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

On segregated workstation PCs, all sensitive information must be appropriately deleted. This also applies to information on defective data carriers. If sensitive information has been stored on a data carrier and the data carrier can no longer be accessed due to a hardware error, the data carrier must be destroyed in an appropriate manner. Recommendations can be found in B 1.15 Deleting and destroying data.

To clear information on Mac OS X, you can use the Disk Utility. If it is the system partition disk, the computer must be started from the Mac OS X Installation DVD and the Disk Utility must be launched from the installation DVD. With this program, a data carrier can be deleted in different ways. In the security options, data should be overwritten with zeros. Administrators need to be trained on Disk Utility and informed about the procedure for securely deleting volumes on Mac OS X.

Before IT systems or data carriers are discarded, they must be examined to see whether they have any data left on them. These must then be backed up or archived on other data carriers. It should be checked that all data has been saved correctly. Further information can be found in M 1.1 Compliance with relevant standards and regulations.
