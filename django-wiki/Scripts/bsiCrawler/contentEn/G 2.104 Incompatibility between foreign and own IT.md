#G 2.104 Incompatibility between foreign and own IT
With the increasing mobility of IT systems and IT users, the problem often arises that IT systems can not be used as planned due to incompatibility. Of course, this is annoying when IT devices have been taken along but can not be used. In addition, attempts to connect the IT systems may result in damage to the devices or the stored data.



## Examples 
* A laptop has been prepared with all the important data for a customer conversation. However, this can not be coupled with the IT at the customer's location, and the data can not be transferred to another computer there because of different interfaces. Thus, the effort and effort put into the preparation of the interview is in vain.
* Attempting to exchange data between two IT systems will report a driver problem. On the advice of another meeting participant, a new driver will be installed on an IT system. This will cause the system to stop booting.
