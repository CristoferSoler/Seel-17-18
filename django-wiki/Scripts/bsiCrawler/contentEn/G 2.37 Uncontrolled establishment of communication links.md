#G 2.37 Uncontrolled establishment of communication links
When using communication cards within an IT system (facsimile, modem or ISDN cards), it is not always obvious to the user what else will be transmitted in addition to their user and protocol information. After activation of a communication card, it is fundamentally possible that it establishes connections to an undesired remote station without initiation by the user, or is addressed by third parties via remote functions not known to the user.



## Examples 
* When configuring a fax card for the first time, the installer asked the user for the country code of Sweden. It can be assumed that the card manufacturer wanted to be informed about the use of his product, possibly for reasons of product marketing.
* A large number of modem cards support remote access to IT systems. Although these accesses can be secured via mechanisms that are partly integrated on the cards (callback option and call number authentication), this is not the default setting. An IT system configured in this way can be completely manipulated from the outside via the modem card.
