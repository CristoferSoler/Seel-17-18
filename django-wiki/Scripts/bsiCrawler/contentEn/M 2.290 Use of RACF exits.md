#M 2.290 Use of RACF exits
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

In addition to the adaptability of RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) with commands and parameters, it is also possible to implement additional security rules through the use of RACF exits. Exits are passed through at various points of the RACF functions and allow individual interventions. Their use requires a high degree of knowledge and experience in assembler programming.

The following recommendations should be followed when using exits:



## Examples 
* Are exits for the expansion of RACF functionality under z / OS implemented by SMP / E as user modem?
* Is it ensured that the DES algorithm or a stronger authentication method is used in the z / OS systems?
* Is there regular control over the use of exits in the context of audits?
