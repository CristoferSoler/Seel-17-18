#G 5.89 Hijacking of network connections
Much more critical than listening to a connection is taking over a connection. In this case, packets are introduced into the network, which either block or redirect the client. The server process can not recognize that another program has replaced the original client. In this assumption of an existing connection, the attacker can exercise any actions in their name after successful authentication of an authorized person.
