#M 2.28 Provision of external TC consulting capacity
Responsible for initiation: IT security officer, PBX manager, IT manager

Responsible for implementation: Head of IT, TK-Anlagen-responsible

In order to be able to rely quickly on expert help in difficult cases, consideration should be given to the provision of appropriate consulting services when buying or renting a telecommunications system. It is important here that in an emergency situation, the support can be provided quickly, since the failure of a PBX significantly affects the ability of a whole institution to act and, if necessary, can only be tolerated for a short time.
