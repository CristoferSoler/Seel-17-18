#G 4.83 Malfunction of self-developed macros under Outlook
Many software vendors provide programming interfaces in their tools and applications for reasons of interoperability. B. as Application Programming Interface (API). These allow you to use certain functions from other programs or to extend the functionality of the application. In doing so, errors and incorrect calculations in macros can pose an increased risk. As a precautionary measure self-developed software with malicious function could also be used for attacks (see G 5.164 Abuse of programming interfaces under Outlook).

Microsoft Outlook provides programming interfaces that allow users to write their own applications or feature enhancements (macros) that can send and receive messages, appointments, and tasks through the client.

Example:

* A macro collects key words for emails in a statistic. The macro incorrectly counts due to an index error. This triggers wrong economic decisions such as purchases or sales.
