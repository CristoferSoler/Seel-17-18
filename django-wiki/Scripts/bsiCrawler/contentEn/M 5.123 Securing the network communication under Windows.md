#M 5.123 Securing the network communication under Windows
Responsible for Initiation: Administrator, IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: Administrator

The security of a Windows infrastructure is not determined solely by the secure configuration and safe operation of individual systems. The overall security also depends essentially on the security in the network communication, which is determined inter alia by securing the communication paths (signatures, encryption) and the authentication mechanisms used.

As a general rule, unused network components (for example, file and printer sharing for Microsoft networks) must be removed from existing interfaces. The assessment of which network protocols should be removed must be made on the basis of specific circumstances and in individual cases.



## Examples 
* Microsoft Network (client): digitally sign communications (if server agrees),
* Microsoft Network (Client): digitally sign communications (always),
* Microsoft network (server): digitally sign communications (if client agrees),
* Microsoft network (server): digitally sign communications (always).
