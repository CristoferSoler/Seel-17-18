#M 2.244 Determination of technical factors influencing electronic archiving
Responsible for Initiation: IT Security Officer

Responsible for implementation: archive administrator, IT security officer

Before a decision can be made as to which methods and products are to be used for electronic archiving, a number of technical influencing factors have to be determined. For this purpose, the owners of the data to be archived should also be interviewed, for example those responsible for the individual IT systems or IT applications and the system administrators. The results can be documented comprehensibly in the archiving concept (see M 2.243 Development of the archiving concept). The technical factors influencing electronic archiving are among others

* the expected data volume,
* the file formats of the documents to be archived,
* the change volume and versioning,
* the retention period of the documents,
* the number and type of accesses,
* the existing IT deployment environment as well
* to observe norms and standards.


The specified influencing factors are shown in more detail below:
