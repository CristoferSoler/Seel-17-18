#G 5.20 Abuse of administrator rights
An abusive administration exists when one uses privileges that have been acquired, either rightfully or illegally, from super-user (root) privileges in order to harm the system or its users.



## Examples 
* Since root is unrestricted on Unix attachments, the administrator can read, modify, or delete any file, regardless of access rights. In addition, he can accept the identity of any user of his system without being noticed by another user, so he is. For example, you can send mails under a foreign name or read and delete foreign mails.
