### 1.1 Introduction

Operational Technology (OT) is hardware and software that detects and effects change through the direct monitoring and / or control of physical devices, processes and events in the enterprise [GART1].

The industry, which includes Critical Infrastructures, includes industrial control systems (ICS) and automation solutions, which are responsible for all kinds of control functions. Further examples are laboratory equipment (eg automated microscope or analysis tools), logistics systems (barcode scanners with small computers) or building management systems.

The customary physical separation of OT from other IT systems and networks in office applications is nowadays only applicable in exceptional cases with increased protection requirements due to increasing integration requirements. Multi-level production steps and their overall control as well as regulatory requirements require an increasing opening across organizational boundaries. This trend is accelerated by the trend towards optimizing manufacturing processes to increase competitiveness in the context of Industry 4.0.

As IT components and technologies from office IT are increasingly being used in OT in addition to OT-specific components, they are now exposed to comparable hazards. At the same time, OTs differ significantly from traditional IT, making it difficult to apply established security procedures. For example, there may be restrictions based on manufacturer specifications or legal requirements that prevent or hinder changes to components. An example of this is the application of security updates or subsequent hardening measures. The OT is generally also subject to significantly longer lifecycles, even beyond the manufacturer support, so that the availability of security updates can not be consistently ensured.

Another major difference for OT is the high availability and integrity requirements, whereas confidentiality is often of secondary importance compared to office IT. Disturbances of these systems can cause risks to life, limb and environment and can usually not be remedied by restarting.

### 1.2 Objective

The goal of the module is to demonstrate suitable requirements for the information security of the OT. He addresses cross-component, conceptual and architectural security requirements.

The module is to be modeled and implemented across the board. In this case, multiple use in different areas of OT in an institution (operator within the meaning of VDI 2182) can not be ruled out since there are different requirements with regard to information security.

### 1.3 Delimitation

Depending on the purpose, industry, IT systems and technology used, as well as the long service life (sometimes without updates), the configuration of the OT can vary greatly, even with comparable applications. When designing the security measures based on the requirements of this module, the existing special features must therefore be taken into account. These can have a significant influence on the design of the security concept. For this reason, the risk analysis can already be of great importance when creating a security concept for the normal protection requirement. This may require multiple use of the device for different areas.

In addition, the surrounding infrastructure of the OT - ie locations, facilities, buildings, rooms, etc. - must be modeled by building blocks that are as specific as possible in order to complement the protective effect of this building block.

2 risk situation
-----------------
The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the field of control technology:

### 2 1 Inappropriate integration of OT into the security organization

Different framework conditions, knowledge and procedures in the areas of office IT and ICS can lead to implementation problems with overarching security requirements. On the one hand, IT security requirements can not be implemented due to technical or process-specific features of ICS systems. On the other hand, ICS-specific information security and safety aspects (aspects of functional security) may not be known to the information security officer of Office IT. This can lead to friction losses in communication and implementation as well as to insufficiently treated or unrecognized risks.

### 2 2 Inappropriate integration of OT into operational processes

Despite the increasing convergence of OT and IT, there are peculiarities that make it difficult to transfer established business operations. Operational interventions in the context of change and (security) incident management for secure configuration, troubleshooting or the import of security updates, for example, can lead to a renewed official release or the loss of manufacturer's support. Unauthorized changes can affect the function of a component and potentially have an impact on its safety functions.

The OT is used to monitor, control and automate technical processes. Disruptions to these systems can lead to production losses, technical or personal damage and environmental damage. These potential effects must be taken into account during operational interventions.

### 2 3 Inadequate access protection

Industrial control systems are increasingly rarely operated completely independently from the outside world. Modern manufacturing and manufacturing processes require an information exchange with upstream and downstream production steps and are often linked to central production planning and control systems (Manifacturing Execution System / Enterprise Resource Planning) of an institution. The electronic exchange of information requires networking of production facilities with third party networks such as office IT or the networks of partners and service providers. Requirements for interactive access from office or mobile workstations as well as operational requirements for the electronic data exchange, such as the provision of software and updates, or for the realization of remote access for a call or service providers promote networking with the outside world.

If the necessary communication channels are too broad or insufficiently secured, attackers can use these access routes for network-based access and for compromising the automation system.

### 2 4 Insufficient protection against malicious programs for OT

Industrial control equipment can be affected by both targeted malicious software attacks and by chance malicious programs aimed at compromising office IT. Possible infection routes result from data transfers, the use of removable media and mobile devices, or the lack of segmentation or control of data traffic.

On the other hand, the use of anti-virus software can also pose risks to OT if there is no manufacturer release for the environment or if fault detection and active system interventions endanger the operation. A similar disruption potential (due to the disruption of connections) can also result from the operation of network-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
In addition, the use of anti-virus software requires regular updates. If this is not guaranteed, new attacks by malicious software can not be detected. This also applies generally to attacks for which the antivirus software has no signatures.

### 2 5 Unsafe projecting process / application development process

Adaptations and advancements of IT systems, applications and control programs represent a critical intervention in the control system. Malfunctions can arise from functional errors in the case of inadequate test and validation steps, faulty or manipulated configuration data or weak points in the software, if important safety functions such as on- and off-hook Issuance or authorization checks are implemented inadequately.

Further dangers may arise from unsafe development environments, improper storage of program code, documentation or project data, as well as from the data transfer interfaces.

### 2 6 Insecure administration concept and remote administration

The management of industrial control systems takes place in certain cases remotely via network access. Here are different public and private networks such. As telephone networks, wireless networks, mobile networks and increasingly the Internet. If these accesses are inadequately planned, configured insecure or are not monitored, attackers may be able to access individual OT components or the infrastructure unauthorized and thus circumvent the security mechanisms at the perimeter.

Local administrators also have privileged rights that make abusive intrusion or compromised accounts attractive to attackers.

### 2 7 Insufficient monitoring and detection procedures

The monitoring of operating states of the process to be automated is an essential function of industrial control systems. For example, warnings that are relevant to the process (eg if levels are exceeded) and technical parameters (eg temperatures, valve positions) are displayed. On the other hand, there is often a lack of adequate monitoring of the supporting IT infrastructure.

If unusual or security-relevant events of such operating environments are not or only insufficiently monitored, attempts to attack, network bottlenecks or foreseeable failures can not be detected early.

In addition, a poor evaluation or confusing presentation of events can lead to warnings and errors being detected late.

### 2 8 Inadequate test concept

Industrial control systems are often subject to high availability requirements. Malfunctions or technical failures may result in serious damage and high follow-up costs. For this reason, systems are often designed to be fail-safe and redundant.

If changes to such an environment are not carefully planned, tuned, and tested in a realistic environment, there is a risk that logical or software engineering failures will be overlooked and system malfunctions will occur. Even updates released by the manufacturer can cause disruptions when modifying or adjusting parameters on the system.

### 2 9 Lack of life cycle concepts

In addition to specific OT components, components, technologies and software from office IT, so-called commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, are increasingly being used. Due to the very long lifecycles in OT, these components are generally operated much longer than usual in office IT, sometimes even beyond the manufacturer support cycles.
As a result, after the manufacturer support expires, updates for vulnerabilities will no longer be available. In contrast, there are often publicly documented vulnerabilities, as well as tools that exploit these vulnerabilities. This also allows unexperienced attackers to successfully penetrate the systems. This also applies if updates are not recorded or only with great delay.

The long operating times can also lead to problems in the procurement of spare parts, if they are no longer produced by the manufacturer. This also applies to possible know-how for the care and maintenance of legacy systems that no longer exists with new employees

### 2 10 Use of unsafe protocols

The OT components communicate with each other via various network protocols and technologies. In addition to protocols and technologies from office IT (eg Ethernet, TCP / IP, WLAN, GSM), ICS-specific protocols are used. These have not always been developed from the point of view of information security and accordingly provide, in part, no or only limited security mechanisms. Information is often transmitted in plain text and without integrity assurance or authentication.

An attacker with access to the network could read or modify the contents of the communication and thus influence the processes, for example by feigning sensor data or falsifying control commands. This applies in particular to protocols used for communication over freely accessible areas, such as radio protocols or in the context of site networking (telecontrol).

### 2 11 Unsafe configurations

In the default configuration of OT components, security measures are not always enabled, which makes it much easier for unauthorized access. Operating insecurely configured components can also threaten the security of other components of the environment, such as when credentials can be retrieved or trusted by other systems.

Examples of insecure configurations include the use of standard passwords, the use of system administration plaintext protocols, the operation of unneeded services, unsecured interfaces, such as: USB or Firewire ports, or disabled security features.

### 2 12 Dependencies of the TDC of IT networks

The OT is now operated less and less self-sufficient. If there are dependencies on other systems, networks or services, failures or security incidents in the IT network also affect the OT.

In particular, if these systems and networks are not under the control of the institution (the operator of the ICS infrastructure), this can severely affect the availability of OTs and processes. In addition, the incident or error can usually only be remedied with external support.

Examples of dependencies on other systems and networks include Internet connectivity (both wired and wireless), shared infrastructure components, operations management and monitoring by service providers, or the use of cloud services.
