### 1.1 Introduction

The ever faster IT development and the increasing demands of the users require many authorities and companies to update the components of their information technology correctly and in a timely manner. It also shows in practice that security holes or malfunctions are often due to incorrect or missing patches and changes. A missing or neglected patch and change management thus quickly leads to gaps in the security of the individual components and thus possible attack points.

The task of patch and change management is generally to design and control controllable changes in applications, infrastructure, documentation, processes and processes.

### 1.2 Objective

This module shows how a functioning patch and change management can be set up in an institution and how the corresponding process can be controlled and optimized.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The descriptions in this module focus on the IT operation, but can also be implemented analogously in other business processes. Change management is the task of planning and controlling changes. Since this process is very time-consuming, the standard requirements of the module are aimed primarily at larger information networks. For smaller institutions the fulfillment of the standard requirements has to be checked, but the effort should not be put above the benefit. Patch management represents a part or specific process within the change management, which aims at the updating of software and is to be applied in each case. The individual building blocks of the SYS and APP layers have additional patch management requirements where necessary.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in patch and change management:

### 2 1 Undefined responsibilities

For example, poorly defined, overlapping, or unclear responsibilities can slow down the categorization and prioritization of change requests, thereby delaying the distribution of patches and changes. Even if patches and changes are released prematurely without test run and consideration of all (technical) aspects, this can have a serious impact on safety.

In extreme cases, poorly defined responsibilities may affect the entire institution in full or in large scale. Faults in the operation affect the availability. Confidentiality and integrity may be affected if security-related patches are not or are distributed late.

### 2 2 Defective communication in change management

If the patch and change management within the institution is poorly accepted or the people involved communicate poorly, it may cause change requests to be delayed, or incorrectly decided on by a change request.

This can reduce overall security levels and seriously disrupt IT operations. In any case, the lack of communication makes the change process inefficient, as it often requires too much time and resources to be invested. This has a negative impact on the institution's responsiveness and, in extreme cases, can lead to security vulnerabilities or important business goals being missed.

### 2 3 Poor consideration of business processes
Incorrect changes can, among other things, affect the smooth running of business processes or even lead to the IT systems involved completely failing. Even a comprehensive test procedure can not completely rule out that a change in the subsequent productive operation proves to be faulty.

If the impact, category or priority of a submitted business process change request is misjudged in the change process, the desired level of security may decrease. Such misjudgments occur predominantly when the IT managers and the responsible specialist departments do not adequately coordinate.

### 2 4 Insufficient resources for patch and change management

Effective patch and change management requires adequate human, time and financial resources. If these are not available, for example, the necessary roles can be filled with unsuitable persons. Also, interfaces for certain information, for example, between IT and the corresponding contact persons in the departments, can not be created, or the required capacities for the infrastructure of the test and distribution environments are not provided. If the staffing, time and financial shortcomings in regular operations can often be compensated, they will prove to be more time-consuming, for example when emergency patches need to be recorded.

### 2 5 Problems with automated distribution of patches and changes

Frequently, patches and changes are not distributed manually, but centrally software-supported. If such software is used, erroneous patches and changes in the entire information network can be deployed, which can result in mass security problems. It is especially serious when many systems simultaneously install software that contains security holes.

If only a few mistakes occur, they can often be remedied by hand. However, it will be problematic if IT systems can not be permanently accessed on the LAN. One example is sales representatives who rarely and irregularly connect their IT systems to the LAN. If the tool is configured to distribute the updates only within a specific time frame and then not all IT systems are reachable, these systems can not be updated.

### 2 6 Poor recovery options for patch and change management

If patches or changes are distributed without a recovery option, or if the recovery routines of the software in use are not or not adequately effective, incorrectly updated software can not be corrected promptly. This can cause important IT systems to fail and high consequential damage. In addition to the integrity of data, especially the availability is at risk here.

### 2 7 Poor consideration of mobile devices

Mobile devices are a particular challenge for change management, as they are not always involved in the automated distribution of patches and changes due to their changing locations and their connection to wireless networks. Also, bandwidth and stable data transmission in mobile devices are not always guaranteed. If such devices are not considered separately in patch and change management, patches and changes may be incomplete, take longer to complete, and always present a security risk.

### 2 8 Inadequate emergency preparedness plan for patch and change management
Patch and change management contributes to the technical implementation of information security in an institution. The IT systems used by this process are critical for IT operations. These include, for example, the central servers that distribute patches and changes, the databases with the current configurations of the IT systems and the backup servers for the recovery points. If, for example, the server that distributes the changes fails, any critical updates that may appear can no longer be timely recorded. Furthermore, missing backups of the current configurations of IT systems can mean that in an emergency it is no longer possible to ensure that important IT components can be restored to their original state as quickly as possible.

### 2 9 Misjudgment of the relevance of patches and changes

If changes are prioritized incorrectly, for example, unimportant patches could be installed first. On the other hand, important patches will be installed too late and vulnerabilities will persist for longer. Patch and change management is often supported by software-based tools. These tools may also contain software errors, making inadequate or incorrect information about a change. If the information that such a tool makes about a change is not checked and tested for plausibility, there may be differences between the actual and assumed implementation of changes.

### 2 10 Manipulation of data and tools in change management

Patch and change management often operates from a central point. Due to its exposed position, it is particularly vulnerable: If attackers succeed in taking over the servers involved, they could simultaneously distribute manipulated software versions to a variety of IT systems via this central point. Often further points of attack arise from the fact that these systems are operated by external partners (outsourcing). Maintenance accesses could also be set up to allow attackers to access the central server for distribution of changes.
