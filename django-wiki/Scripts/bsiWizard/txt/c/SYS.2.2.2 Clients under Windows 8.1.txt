### 1.1 Introduction

With Windows 8, Microsoft has further developed its Windows client operating system and the functions and components it introduces. New to Windows 8 is the use of portable touchscreen devices. This brings a new operating concept for applications. In addition to the classic desktop applications, Microsoft has provided a class of mobile applications for use under Windows 8, the so-called "apps". These are consistently designed for control by touch. In addition, they can perceive display functions as "tiles" on the screen. Some applications, most notably the Windows 8-based Internet Explorer, are available in two variants for Windows 8. Since the release of Windows 8, Microsoft has made some improvements and integrated them into the operating system, which is now version 8.1.

### 1.2 Objective

The goal of this module is to protect information that will be processed by and on Windows 8.1 clients.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This block applies to all target objects on which the operating system Windows 8.1 is operated. Insofar as the described safety requirements and threats apply exclusively to Windows 8, this is explicitly stated in the texts. The requirements from the block [* SYS.2.1 General Client *] (DE / topics / IT Grundschutz / IT Grundschutz Compendium / modules / SYS / SYS_2_1_General_Client.html? Nn = 10137184 "SYS.2.1 General Client") must also be met in every case. This module clarifies and complements requirements that are specific to Windows 8.1. Application programs that are used on the Windows clients must meet the requirements of the corresponding blocks, for example APP.1.1 Office products or APP.1.6 Browser. When used in a Windows domain, the requirements of the corresponding components such as APP.2.2 Active Directory must be met.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​*** *** Windows 8.1:

### 2 1 Malware targeted to Windows

Malicious programs provide an attacker with extensive communication and control options and have a variety of functions. Among other things, malicious programs can specifically search passwords, remotely control systems, deactivate protection software and spy on data. A removable disk could be manipulated to run and install malware when the removable disk is inserted or connected. In particular, loss or falsification of information or applications is of paramount importance. But also a loss of image and financial damage, which can thus result from malicious programs, is of great importance. Windows is a prime target for malware attacks because of its widespread adoption, posing a major threat from numerous attackers and attack types.

### 2 2 Software vulnerabilities or errors

Windows 8.1, including its many included applications, is a very complex software product. If software errors are not detected in time, the crashes or errors that occur during the application can lead to far-reaching consequences (such as incorrect calculation results, wrong management decisions, and delays in business processes). Software vulnerabilities or errors can cause serious security vulnerabilities in individual applications, in the entire IT system or even in all IT systems networked with them. Vulnerabilities in Windows can sometimes be exploited by attackers to inject malicious software, unauthorized read or manipulate data.

### 2 3 Integrated cloud functionalities
Windows 8.1 includes many features that store and synchronize data in Microsoft's cloud services. There is a risk of unconsciously (or at least carelessly) using cloud services for possibly sensitive or personal data. At the same time, data protection laws may also be violated if data is stored by third parties, especially abroad. If a user with an already activated Microsoft account logs on to a new device, the Microsoft cloud services he uses are automatically set up there. Thus, data of the company can be unintentionally synchronized to the employees' private devices. As another example, Windows 8 provides the ability to back up the Bitlocker recovery key directly from the Microsoft account in the cloud. This puts critical cryptographic secrets in the hands of third parties.

### 2 4 Impairment of software functions due to compatibility issues

Software that was successfully run on previous versions of Windows does not have to work with a current version of the operating system. Possible causes are new security features or operating system features, as well as the omission of functionalities or services. As a result, the software can not be used or only with restrictions. For example, new versions of Windows can cause the activation of new security features to cause compatibility issues. Examples include User Account Control (UAC) or 64-bit versions of the Kernel Patch Guard operating system, and the need for signed drivers. For newer versions of Windows but also eliminated functionality. An example of this is the omission of the GINA login component in newer versions of Windows, the z. B. was used by some fingerprint readers.

### 2 5 Incorrect administration or use of devices and systems

Windows operating systems are complex systems whose security is essentially determined by the set parameters. In particular, misconfiguration of components can compromise security, causing malfunction or compromising the IT system. Basically, any interface to an IT system not only includes the ability to legitimately use certain services of the IT system, but also the risk of unauthorized access to the IT system. If, for example, user IDs and associated passwords can be spied out due to misconfiguration of the Windows own authentication mechanisms, then unauthorized use of the applications or IT systems protected by this is conceivable.

Improper or improper use of devices, systems, and applications can also affect security in Windows, especially if existing security measures are disregarded or circumvented. Too generously granted rights, easy-to-guess passwords, insufficiently protected data carriers with backup copies or jobs that are not locked in case of temporary absence can lead to security incidents. Another consequence of improper operation of Windows systems or applications may be the accidental deletion or modification of data. It is also possible for confidential information to reach the public, for example if access rights are set incorrectly.
