### 1.1 Introduction

Today, almost all strategic and operational functions and tasks are significantly supported by information technology (IT) or can not be executed without IT. As a result, the demands on the performance and availability of the IT systems and their connection to the network environment are steadily increasing. To meet this need for power, maintain reserves, and run IT economically, government agencies and companies of all sizes are concentrating their data center IT landscape.

A data center (RZ) is defined as follows:

If a data center deviates from this definition, the considered IT operating area is referred to as a server room. This definition is based exclusively on the importance of the IT structure for the task fulfillment of the using institution and is thus in methodological harmony with DIN EN 50600.

If a server room is to be protected, the requirements of this module can be reduced accordingly. However, this must be substantiated reasonably and comprehensibly (according to 6.) and at least the basic requirements must be implemented.

### 1.2 Objective

On the one hand, the module addresses institutions that run a data center and want to check whether they have implemented appropriate security measures in the course of a revision. On the other hand, the building block can also be used to estimate the security measures that must be implemented when centralizing IT in a data center. The ultimate goal of the requirements described in this module is to maintain the secure operation of the data center.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The subject of this module are only data centers of medium type and quality. The security requirements described here are not sufficient to protect high-security data centers, such as those used in the banking sector. A high-security data center differs above all in terms of high availability, disaster tolerance, component redundancy, elemental damage resistance, energy efficiency and data security from the average data centers considered here.

Furthermore, the present module is not suitable for small information networks with z. B. only one or very few servers or IT systems. An example of this is a small, medium-sized enterprise (SME) with few IT workstations and a server that is located in a separate room. In such cases, it is often sufficient to implement the INF.6 * protective cabinet / technical room * module.

In order to keep the module manageable, it deliberately avoided technical details and planning parameters. Further information can be found in relevant standards, eg. Eg DIN EN 50600.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance to data centers:

### 2 1 Incorrect planning

If a data center is designed and ignored to protect against elementary threats, there is a very high risk of failure. So z. For example, site risks such as air traffic, earthquakes, floods, or political issues may jeopardize operational safety and availability. It can also have a massive impact on the operation of a new data center if there is insufficient bandwidth available due to incorrect design or if the energy supply at the selected location is insufficient.

### 2 2 Unauthorized access
Lack of access controls or these are insufficient, increases the risk that unauthorized persons enter the data center and there negligent, z. B. due to lack of expertise, or intentionally cause damage. Attackers can so z. For example, stealing sensitive data, stealing devices or manipulating servers. Inadequate access controls thus have a particular impact on the availability, confidentiality and integrity of data or IT components.

### 2 3 Insufficient monitoring

If the IT and infrastructure operated in the data center are insufficiently monitored and maintained, components can go unnoticed. This may severely affect the availability and accuracy of the data center. In addition, failures often occur creepingly. Without active monitoring, they might be noticed too late. It is then often not possible to react in time.

### 2 4 Insufficient air conditioning in the data center

IT components need a certain operating temperature to function properly. They also convert their energy into additional heat. If a data center is not or insufficiently air-conditioned, the climatic conditions in the room can not be kept stable. If it is too cold or too hot, the devices may undercut or exceed their permissible operating temperature. The consequences are z. B. malfunctions and failures of technical components or damaged storage media.

### 2 5 fire

If a data center has no or only insufficient fire protection, there is a risk of a fire developing and spreading rapidly. Fire and smoke can cause great damage. Also, arcing may not prevent early.

### 2 6 water

Leakages in the data center infrastructure, floods, burst pipes, faulty sprinkler systems, sewer damage or even air conditioning faults can cause water to enter the data center. This can cause devices to become damaged or stop working. Also could be triggered such a short circuit, which leads to total failure or even causes a fire.

### 2 7 Missing or inadequate burglary protection

A missing or poor burglary protection makes it easy for unauthorized persons to penetrate a data center. Offenders can so z. B. stealing or manipulating IT components and accessing confidential information. They could also destroy the devices or damage the data center as a whole.

### 2 8 Power failure

If the power fails and there is no redundant power supply, this can lead to significant disruptions in the operation of a data center and thus the institution. For example, in the event of a power outage, all IT services provided by the data center are suddenly unreachable. Also, data can be lost. Furthermore, it is possible that a sudden power failure will damage IT systems, active network components, telecommunications systems or surveillance technology.

### 2 9 pollution

Dust and other contaminants in a data center can cause the technology to stop working. Due to contamination, it precipitates more often and wears out sooner.

### 2 10 Insufficient roadway dimensioning
If cable runs are not routed separately and minimum clearances are not met, data center IT disruptions can occur. Also extensions of the network can be problematic, so that the protection against fire and smoke developments may no longer be guaranteed. It should also be noted that only 60% of the cross-section of cable penetration holes in firewalls may be covered by cables. 40% must be filled with fire-retardant mortar or another material approved for firefighting. Failure to comply with this requirement may cause the fire from the adjacent room to easily spread to the RZ.
