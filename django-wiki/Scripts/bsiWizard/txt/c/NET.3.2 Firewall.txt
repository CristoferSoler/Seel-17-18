### 1.1 Introduction

A firewall is a system of software and hardware components that is used to securely couple IP-based data networks. For this purpose, the technically possible is restricted to the communication defined as secure in a security policy by means of a firewall structure. Security here means that only the desired accesses or data streams between different networks are allowed.

In order to secure gateways, it is often no longer a single component that is used, but a whole range of IT systems that perform different tasks, such as: For example, you can only filter packets or strictly disconnect network connections using proxy functions. The term Application Level Gateway (ALG) used in this module refers to a firewall component that regulates data streams based on security proxies.

A firewall is used at the central junction between trusted networks. Differently trusted networks do not necessarily represent only the combination of Internet / Intranet. Rather, two institution-internal networks can also have different levels of protection requirements, eg. For example, the network of office communication usually has a different need for protection than the network of the personnel department, in which particularly sensitive personal data is transmitted.

### 1.2 Objective

The goal of the module is to be able to use a firewall or a firewall structure securely in order to securely connect networks with different protection requirements.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The building block builds on the building block NET.1.1 * Network Architecture and Design * and contains concrete requirements that must be observed and fulfilled when network-based firewalls are procured, constructed, configured and operated.

In order to secure networks, more network components are usually required, eg. For example, routers and switches. Requirements for this are not listed in this module, but can be found in NET.3.1 * Routers and Switches *. If a firewall takes on the role of a router or switch, it also has to meet the requirements of the NET.3.1 * Router and Switches * block.

In addition, it does not cover products such as Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW) or Unified Threat Management Firewalls, which also contain functional enhancements, such as: Eg VPN, intrusion detection and intrusion prevention (IDS / IPS) systems, virus scanners or spam filters. Safety aspects of these functional extensions are not the subject of the present module, but z. This is, for example, covered in the blocks NET.3.3 * VPN *, NET.3.4 * IDS / IPS *, OPS1.1.4 * Protection against malicious programs *.

Likewise, no application recognition or filtering is discussed. It is a common feature of Next Generation Firewalls and IDS / IPS. Since the implementations differ between the products, it is recommended that they be viewed individually depending on the application scenario. In this module is also not discussed on the individual protection options for externally offered server services, z. For example, through a reverse proxy or for web services using a Web Application Firewall (WAF). In addition, aspects of infrastructural safety (eg suitable installation or power supply) are not listed in this module, but can be found in the respective building blocks of the INF layer.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the firewall area:

### 2 1 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
In a DDoS attack on a protected network (eg TCP-SYN-Flooding, UDP Packet Storm) the firewall may fail due to the many network connections that need to be processed. This can result in certain services in the Local Area Network (LAN) becoming unavailable or the entire LAN failing.

### 2 2 Manipulation

If an attacker succeeds in gaining unauthorized access to a firewall system or a corresponding administration interface, he can manipulate files there as he sees fit. For example, he can change the configuration, start additional services or install malicious software. Likewise, he can record the communication connections on the manipulated system. For example, the firewall rules can be changed to access the firewall and intranet of the institution from the Internet. Furthermore, an attacker can initiate a denial of service (DoS) attack by blocking access to individual server services in the policy.

### 2 3 Software vulnerabilities or errors

Firewalls are complex systems and are subject to numerous attacks, especially at the transition from the intranet to the Internet. Therefore, firewall manufacturers regularly release updates and patches to address software bugs and known vulnerabilities in their products. However, if these are not recorded or played too late, the firewall system can be successfully attacked. This makes it possible for attackers to manipulate the systems to drain business-critical data, disrupt services or shut down entire production processes.

### 2 4 Bypassing the firewall rules

Â Attackers can bypass firewall rules (for example, by fragmentation attacks) by using basic mechanisms in network protocols to penetrate a firewall-protected area. In the protected area, they can then cause further damage (eg read out, manipulate or delete sensitive data).

### 2 5 Incorrect configuration and operating error of a firewall

An improperly configured or incorrectly operated firewall can seriously affect the availability of services. If, for example, firewall rules are set incorrectly, network access can be blocked. Furthermore, faulty configurations can lead to IT systems being no longer completely protected or even no longer protected. In the worst case, internal services for attackers can be reached.
