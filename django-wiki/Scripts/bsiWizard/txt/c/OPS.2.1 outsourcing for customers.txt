### 1.1 Introduction

In outsourcing, institutions (outsourcing customers) outsource all or part of their business processes and services (eg, security or cleaning staff) to external service providers (outsourcing service providers). The operation of hardware and software can also be outsourced as a service. Regardless of what is outsourced, every outsourcing requires close ties to the external service provider and their service quality and service quality. This ratio is particularly for the customer not only opportunities, but also associated with significant risks, such. As strong dependencies, loss of their own know-how and loss of control and control. Information security aspects must therefore be adequately considered during the entire life cycle of outsourcing.

This module focuses on requirements that outsourcing customers should adhere to or implement during each phase of an outsourcing project.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to ensure that all security objectives of the outsourcing customer are met even after the outsourcing of business processes or services to an outsourcing service provider and that the agreed level of security is permanently maintained (or improved). Outsourcing should not result in any uncontrollable risks to the outsourcing institution regarding information security.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This building block contains hazards and security requirements from the point of view of outsourcing customers and is limited solely to the requirements of protection of information from the outsourcing institution.

Transmission paths to outsourcing service providers can not be secured by implementing the requirements.

The terms outsourcing and cloud have many parallels. For outsourcing customers, there are usually additional requirements for the use of cloud services.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in customer outsourcing:

### 2 1 Lack of or inadequate information security regulations

An outsourcing project typically transfers large amounts of information between the customer and the outsourcing service provider. Depending on the protection requirements of the information to be processed, missing or inadequate regulations can cause damage. This is the case, for example, if the regulations and instructions for controlling the service provider are not updated in the event of technical, organizational or personnel changes, for example, if contact persons change. The spectrum of regulatory deficits ranges from ambiguity in responsibilities and control functions to incomprehensible or incoherent formulated regulations, up to completely missing regulations.

### 2 2 Inappropriate access, access and access rights management

Depending on the outsourcing plans, it may be necessary for the outsourcing customer's employees to have access, access and access rights to IT systems, information, buildings or rooms of the outsourcing service provider. If the allocation, administration and control of these rights is poorly regulated and, in extreme cases, even unauthorized rights are granted, it is no longer possible to guarantee the necessary protection requirements for the outsourced customer's information. For example, the uncontrolled assignment of administrative authorizations to employees of the outsourcing service provider can lead to serious security risks. These could exploit permissions and copy or manipulate sensitive information.

### 2 3 Missing or inadequate testing and approval process
If an outsourcing customer has not defined adequate requirements for testing and approval procedures for the outsourcing service provider, existing errors in the hardware and software or security gaps in the configuration may not be detected or not detected in good time. This lack can lead to the fact that the necessary protection of the information of the outsourcing customer can not be guaranteed any longer. If testing reveals that new components or updates result in significant changes to workflows, or more resources (eg, memory, processor capacity) are required for acceptable processing speed, and this is not reported to the customer, this can result in significant failure. or subsequent investments.

### 2 4 Inadequate contractual arrangements with an outsourcing service provider

Due to inadequate contractual arrangements with an outsourcing service provider, various and serious security problems can arise. If tasks, performance parameters or expenses have been described insufficiently or misleadingly, the consequence may be that security measures are not implemented due to ignorance or lack of resources. This can have a variety of negative consequences, such as non-compliance with regulatory requirements and obligations, failure to comply with disclosure obligations and laws, and failure to take responsibility for loss of control and control.

### 2 5 Inadequate regulations for the end of an outsourcing

Without sufficient and appropriate regulations for the resolution of an outsourcing contract by the outsourcing customer, there is the danger that the outsourcing customer will find it difficult to get rid of the outsourcing service provider. On the other hand, it can also happen that termination of the outsourcing service provider, which is possible too soon, forces outsourcing customers to choose an inappropriate new outsourcing service provider. In either case, it may be difficult or even impossible to transfer the outsourced area to another service provider or reintegrate it into one's own institution. This can lead to a variety of security problems, for example, during the dissolution process, data and systems could no longer be adequately protected, since these are regarded as "old systems". Inadequate regulations for the deletion of data, including data backups, can lead to the disclosure of confidential data to third parties.

### 2 6 Dependence on an outsourcing service provider

By opting for outsourcing, an institution always becomes dependent on the outsourcing service provider. This dependency involves the risk that know-how will be lost and that there will no longer be complete control over the outsourced processes and components. In addition, the protection needs of the outsourced business processes and information may differ, resulting in inadequate security measures. By having full control over business processes, sensitive information, resources, and IT systems while reducing the knowledge of outsourcing customers, outsourcing service providers may no longer notice information security deficiencies.

This situation could be exploited by the outsourcing service provider, for example through drastic price increases and insufficient service quality.

### 2 7 Disruption of the working climate due to an outsourcing project
Outsourcing projects are often viewed as negative changes from the point of view of the employees of the outsourcing institution. This often leads to a bad working environment. Employees of the outsourcing client often fear for them adverse task changes or even downsizing through outsourcing projects. In the event of a negative attitude towards the outsourcing project, employees could unintentionally or willfully neglect security measures, take a boycott position or even take acts of revenge. In addition, this could terminate know-how carriers (such as IT managers and the IT operation) during the introductory phase, so that the outsourcing project can not be implemented as planned.

### 2 8 Poor information security in the outsourcing implementation phase

The introductory phase of outsourcing projects is often characterized by tight deadlines and financial targets. This can lead to lack of security controls and audits or reviews and other quality assurance measures remain, for example, when creating security concepts. Transitional measures with security deficits will remain a habit over time and due to resource constraints over years. This creates the concrete danger that this will establish a "project climate" that will lead to further serious safety deficiencies.

### 2 9 Failure of the systems of an outsourcing service provider

In the case of an outsourcing service provider, the IT systems and processes operated there can partially or completely fail, which also affects the outsourcing customer. In the event of inadequate client separation, the failure of a system that is not assigned to the outsourcing customer may still result in the outsourcing customer being unable to retrieve its contractually guaranteed service. Similar problems arise when the connection between outsourcing service provider and customer fails.

### 2 10 Weaknesses when connecting to an outsourcing service provider

If the IT connection between the outsourcing service provider and the outsourcing customer is insufficiently secured in an outsourcing project, the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data may be jeopardized. However, open or poorly secured interfaces could also result in unauthorized access for outsiders to the systems of the participating institutions.

### 2 11 Lack of multi-client capability at the outsourcing service provider

Outsourcing service providers usually have many different customers who use the same resource base (eg IT systems, networks, personnel). If the IT systems and data of the different customers are not sufficiently separated from each other, there is a risk that one customer will be able to access the area of ​​another customer. In addition, there could be conflicts of interest with the outsourcing service provider if he has to meet parallel comparable resource requirements. If the respective customers are in a competitive situation, this can be particularly problematic.
