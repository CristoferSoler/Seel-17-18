### 1.1 Introduction

The electrotechnical cabling of IT systems and other equipment includes all cables and distributions in the building from the point of entry of the distribution system operator to the electrical connections of the consumers.

Proper and standard compliant electrical wiring is the basis for secure IT operation.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is the protection of the entire electrical wiring against failure and disruption of the power supply.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The IT cabling for communication of the IT systems is dealt with in a separate module (see INF.4 IT cabling).

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​electrotechnical cabling:

### 2 1 Cable fire

If a cable burns, either by spontaneous combustion or by flame, this can have various consequences. Some of these consequences are, for example, short circuits, the interruption of the protective conductor, the development of aggressive gases, fire or the development of smoldering fires. Cable fires often cause only a slight increase in temperature during the development phase. Thus, there is the additional risk that a significant amount of smoke by "cold" smoke occurs before smoke detectors attached to the ceiling.

### 2 2 Inadequate dimensioning of electrotechnical cabling

When planning workplaces, server rooms or data centers, it is often the mistake to orientate these exclusively to current needs. It is overlooked that the capacity of the power grid has to be expanded by new requirements such as the use of additional servers. However, an extension of the electrotechnical cabling is only possible to the extent permitted by the existing, laid cables or the space available for additional cables and distributions.

### 2 3 Insufficient documentation of the wiring

If, due to insufficient documentation, the exact position of pipes is not known, construction work outside or inside a building may cause damage to pipes. It can not be assumed that all cables and wires in the installation zones are installed according to valid standards. Insufficient documentation also makes it difficult to inspect, maintain and repair cables.

### 2 4 Insufficient protected distributors

Sub-distributions of the power supply network are often freely accessible and unlocked housed in corridors or staircases. This makes it possible for anyone to open these distributors, make manipulations and possibly cause a power failure. Furthermore, from such distributors pose an immediate danger, since after removal of screw fuses and their sockets direct contact live parts is possible. Open doors on the junction boxes can also hinder the traffic route, and injuries due to jamming and pinching at the shear edges are also possible.

### 2 5 Line damage

The more unprotected a cable is, the greater the risk of damage. Damage does not necessarily immediately lead to a failure of connections. The accidental formation of impermissible connections is possible if, for example, cable sheaths or insulation are no longer completely intact. Damage does not necessarily have to be intentional, but may also occur unintentionally.

### 2 6 Voltage fluctuations and overvoltage or undervoltage
Fluctuations in the supply voltage can lead to malfunctions and damage to the IT. The fluctuations range from extremely short and small events that have little or no IT impact, to total failures or destructive surges. The cause of this can arise in all areas of the power supply network, from the utility company's network to the circuit to which the respective equipment is connected.

### 2 7 Use of insufficient power strips

Often, the number of fixed sockets for the amount of devices to be operated is not enough. To compensate for this deficiency, then typically socket strips are used. Such power strips provide, if they are of insufficient quality, a dangerous source of ignition and thus a major fire hazard. In addition, several smaller power strips connected in series to provide sufficient slots for all devices, the risk increases due to low line cross-section and overload on.
