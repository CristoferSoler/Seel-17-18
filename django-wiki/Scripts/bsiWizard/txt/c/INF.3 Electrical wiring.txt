### 1.1 Introduction

The electrotechnical cabling of IT systems and other equipment includes all cables and distributions in the building from the point of entry of the distribution system operator to the electrical connections of the consumers.

Proper and standard compliant electrical wiring is the basis for secure IT operation.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is the protection of the entire electrical wiring against failure and disruption of the power supply.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The IT cabling for communication of the IT systems is dealt with in a separate module (see INF.4 IT cabling).

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​electrotechnical cabling:

### 2 1 Cable fire

If a cable burns, either by spontaneous combustion or by flame, this can have various consequences. Some of these consequences are, for example, short circuits, the interruption of the protective conductor, the development of aggressive gases, fire or the development of smoldering fires. Cable fires often cause only a slight increase in temperature during the development phase. Thus, there is the additional risk that a significant amount of smoke by "cold" smoke occurs before smoke detectors attached to the ceiling.

### 2 2 Inadequate dimensioning of electrotechnical cabling

When planning workplaces, server rooms or data centers, it is often the mistake to orientate these exclusively to current needs. It is overlooked that the capacity of the power grid has to be expanded by new requirements such as the use of additional servers. However, an extension of the electrotechnical cabling is only possible to the extent permitted by the existing, laid cables or the space available for additional cables and distributions.

### 2 3 Insufficient documentation of the wiring

If, due to insufficient documentation, the exact position of pipes is not known, construction work outside or inside a building may cause damage to pipes. It can not be assumed that all cables and wires in the installation zones are installed according to valid standards. Insufficient documentation also makes it difficult to inspect, maintain and repair cables.

### 2 4 Insufficient protected distributors

Sub-distributions of the power supply network are often freely accessible and unlocked housed in corridors or staircases. This makes it possible for anyone to open these distributors, make manipulations and possibly cause a power failure. Furthermore, from such distributors pose an immediate danger, since after removal of screw fuses and their sockets direct contact live parts is possible. Open doors on the junction boxes can also hinder the traffic route, and injuries due to jamming and pinching at the shear edges are also possible.

### 2 5 Line damage

The more unprotected a cable is, the greater the risk of damage. Damage does not necessarily immediately lead to a failure of connections. The accidental formation of impermissible connections is possible if, for example, cable sheaths or insulation are no longer completely intact. Damage does not necessarily have to be intentional, but may also occur unintentionally.

### 2 6 Voltage fluctuations and overvoltage or undervoltage
Fluctuations in the supply voltage can lead to malfunctions and damage to the IT. The fluctuations range from extremely short and small events that have little or no IT impact, to total failures or destructive surges. The cause of this can arise in all areas of the power supply network, from the utility company's network to the circuit to which the respective equipment is connected.

### 2 7 Use of insufficient power strips

Often, the number of fixed sockets for the amount of devices to be operated is not enough. To compensate for this deficiency, then typically socket strips are used. Such power strips, if they are of inadequate quality, a dangerous source of ignition and thus a major fire hazard. In addition, several smaller power strips connected in series to provide sufficient slots for all devices, the risk increases due to low line cross-section and overload on.

3 requirements
---------------

The following are specific requirements for the area of ​​electrotechnical cabling. Basically, the Head of Domestic Engineering is responsible for fulfilling the requirements. The Information Security Officer (ISB) should always be involved in strategic decisions. In addition, the ISB is responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy. In addition, there may be other roles that have additional responsibilities in the implementation of requirements. These are then listed explicitly in square brackets in the heading of the respective requirements.

### 3.1 Basic requirements

The following requirements MUST be implemented as a priority:

#### INF.3.A1 Selection of suitable cable types

When selecting cables, it is important to take into account transmission requirements and environmental conditions during installation and operation. When selecting electrical cables MUST observe the relevant standards and regulations. With regard to the environmental conditions, factors such as As the temperatures, cable routes, tensile forces during installation, the type of installation and any sources of interference are observed.

#### INF.3.A2 Planning the cable management [Head IT]

Cables, cable trays and cable trays MUST be adequately dimensioned before they are installed, both from a functional and a physical point of view. In doing so, future electrotechnical necessities MUST be taken into account as well as sufficient space for possible technical expansions in cable ducts and routes. When co-routing IT and power cabling in a path, care must be taken to avoid crosstalk between the individual cables. It SHOULD generally be ensured that IT cables are routed separately from the electrotechnical cabling. It MUST be taken to avoid identifiable sources of danger.

#### INF.3.A3 Professional installation

The installation work of the electrical wiring MUST be done carefully and expertly. At the same time, all relevant standards MUST be observed. The decisive criteria for a professional execution of the electrotechnical wiring MUST therefore be checked by the client in all phases. Upon delivery of the material, MUST verify that the correct cables and connectors have been supplied. When installing power cables, special care must be taken to ensure that the installation does not cause damage and that the cable routes are such that damage to the routed cables due to normal use of the building is excluded.

### 3.2 Standard requirements
Together with the basic requirements, the following requirements correspond to the state of the art in the area of ​​electrical wiring. They SHOULD be implemented in principle.

#### INF.3.A4 Requirements analysis for the electrotechnical cabling

Basically, an analysis of the requirements that have an influence on a future-proof, needs-based and economic execution of the electrical wiring should be carried out. In it SHOULD first the short-term planned use by the users in the institution and on this basis the longer-term development of the use be estimated.

#### INF.3.A5 Decrease in electrotechnical cabling

The electrotechnical wiring SHOULD be subjected to a acceptance process. A decrease SHOULD only take place when all tasks to be performed have been completed, the contractor has reported the action for acceptance and no unacceptable deficiencies have been identified during the inspections by the contracting authority. The acceptance date SHOULD be selected in time so that the controls can be prepared for acceptance in sufficient time. In addition to the correct billing and the actual scope of the services, compliance with the different standards for electrical wiring MUST be checked during the acceptance. For the acceptance protocol a checklist SHOULD be prepared. The checklist SHOULD also contain points regarding general requirements for the operating rooms. The acceptance report MUST be signed by the participants and responsible persons. The protocol SHOULD be part of the internal documentation of the cabling.

#### INF.3.A6 overvoltage protection

Each electrically conductive network SHOULD be protected against overvoltages. For this, an overvoltage protection concept complying with the valid standards MUST be created. Emergency power systems and uninterruptible power supplies SHOULD be included in the concept.

#### INF.3.A7 Removing and Disabling Unnecessary Lines

When power cables are no longer needed, they should be removed properly and completely. Subsequently, the fireboards MUST be closed professionally. Cabling, which can be usefully used as reserve with the existing technology, SHOULD be maintained in an operable state. Such cables MUST be marked accordingly at least at the end points. Basically, an overview of cables that are no longer needed should be set up and the deactivation or dismantling / removal of the cables should be documented on the basis of this documentation. Subsequently, the corresponding documentation MUST be updated.

#### INF.3.A8 Fire protection in paths

To avoid cable fires SHOULD TRAILS be dimensioned sufficiently. In addition, after completion of the installation work, the occupation density of the routes should be checked at reasonable intervals.

#### INF.3.A9 Documentation and marking of electrotechnical cabling

An institution SHOULD make sure that it has internal and external documentation for its electrotechnical cabling. The internal documentation MUST include all records related to the installation and operation of the cabling. The internal documentation SHOULD be prepared and maintained so extensively that the operation and future development are best supported. The external documentation of the wiring SHOULD be kept as neutral as possible.

#### INF.3.A10 Neutral documentation in the distributors
Each distributor SHOULD have a documentation showing the current status of shunting and line assignments. This documentation SHOULD be kept as neutral as possible and MUST allow safe switching. Only existing and used connections, as well as accumulating reserve lines should be listed therein. Unless expressly required, there should be no indications as to the type of use of the pipes. All further information SHOULD be listed in a revision documentation.

#### INF.3.A11 Control of electrical equipment and connections

All electrotechnical equipment, distributors and drawers of the wiring SHOULD be regularly subjected to a (at least random) visual inspection. In addition to the pure visual inspection, a functional control SHOULD additionally be carried out, if such a check has not already been carried out within the framework of the DGUV V3 examination. Any irregularities detected during visual inspections or functional inspections MUST be documented immediately and reported to the appropriate organizational units. The responsible organizational units MUST then review and correct the irregularities found.

#### INF.3.A12 Avoidance of electrical ignition sources

The use of private electrical appliances within an institution SHOULD be clearly regulated. All electrical appliances SHOULD BE checked by a qualified electrician and found safe before use. The use of power strips should be avoided as much as possible. Missing sockets SHOULD be retrofitted by an electrician into existing duct systems or professionally mounted on plaster.

### 3.3 Requirements for increased protection requirements

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that go beyond the level of protection afforded by the state of the art and should BE considered AT INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### INF.3.A13 Secondary Power Supply (A)

The primary energy supply from an energy supply company's network SHOULD be supplemented with emergency care measures in response to increased availability requirements. For this purpose, a sufficiently dimensioned central UPS and a network backup system (NEA) SHOULD be set up for the areas to be protected. It SHOULD be checked if the connections to the network operator should be redundant. NEA and UPS MUST be serviced regularly.

#### INF.3.A14 A-B supply (A)

It SHOULD be examined whether a two-way, so-called A-B supply should be created in addition to the normal single power supply of important IT components. It should be ensured that their functionality permanently by suitable technical facilities, such. B. by the building control system (GLT), is monitored.

#### INF.3.A15 Material security of electrical wiring (A)

In rooms with public access or in confusing areas of a building SHOULD be considered to secure lines and distributors against unauthorized access. In any case, the number and extent of sites where power supply facilities are accessible to unauthorized persons SHOULD be minimized.

#### INF.3.A16 Use of Cabinet Systems (A)

To improve the operational safety of electrical connections and distributors, these devices SHOULD be installed or installed in cabinet systems.
The IT hardware should, as far as possible, be housed in cabinet systems. These SHOULD meet the depth and width of the increasing space requirements of the built-in appliances and be equipped with appropriate additional equipment or be retrofitted at any time.

#### INF.3.A17 firewall cadastre (A)

A firewall cadastre was to be run. In this, all types of bulkhead SHOULD be individually recorded. After working on firebox, the changes in the cadastre SHOULD be entered at the latest after 4 weeks.
