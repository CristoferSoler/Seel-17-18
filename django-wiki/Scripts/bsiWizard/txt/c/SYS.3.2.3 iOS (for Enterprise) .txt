### 1.1 Introduction

Mobile devices are a constant companion in today's information society. They are constantly online, that is connected to the Internet or the internal institutional network, and thus provide access to digital information at all times. Communication takes place via various interfaces, examples being GSM / UMTS / LTE, WLAN, Bluetooth.

Smartphones and tablets are widely used today due to modern, simple operating concepts and high performance. These include the Apple-produced mobile devices iPhone and iPad with the iOS operating system. Originally, these devices were designed for home use. However, due to the reorganization of infrastructures and the way in which information is collected and processed, they are increasingly being used in the professional environment and even partially replacing notebooks.

With the integration of business features, since version 4 iOS has been progressively expanded for enterprise and government use and administrative features have been integrated from an institutional perspective. These include Apple's centralized device registration program and options such as single sign-on (SSO).

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to show how devices running iOS (for Enterprise) can be safely used in institutions. For this purpose, requirements for settings of the iOS-based devices are set up, which can be distributed in the form of configuration profiles on the terminals. iOS configuration profiles contain uniformly defined settings such as: For example, security policies or individual system aspects to manage and automatically configure iOS-based devices in a consistent and centralized manner.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The building block contains basic requirements that must be observed and fulfilled when operating iOS-based devices that are integrated into the processes of the institution. Requirements for integration into the institution's security or collaboration infrastructure are not the focus of this module. With a so-called "Mobile Device Management" (MDM), it is possible to centrally manage the devices and to roll out configuration profiles for each user group or purpose. An MDM can also be used to enforce safeguards uniformly. It is assumed that the iOS-based devices are integrated into such an MDM. Requirements for the operation of such MDMs can be found in the block SYS.3.2.2 MDM. For smaller environments, the Apple Configurator can also be used to roll out the requirements listed in this module to multiple devices. General and overarching aspects of the operation of smartphones and tablets regardless of the operating system used on them can be found in the SYS.3.2.1 smartphone / tablet module.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the iOS (Apple) area:

### 2 1 Missing or bad quality of the device code (passcode)

The so-called code lock locks iOS-based devices against unauthorized access. If this feature is not activated, or if it uses an easily guessable code and can be bypassed, there is an increased risk of unauthorized access to iOS-based devices. In addition, the device code used is an essential part of the entropy of certain encryption codes.

### 2 2 Jailbreak
In the previous versions of the iOS operating system, vulnerabilities were mostly found that make it possible to undermine Apple's established security framework and thus access system processes and protected storage areas. So-called "jailbreak" exploit these vulnerabilities, for example, to be able to use alternative app stores or Apple's unwanted extensions. Jailbreaking techniques are used by attackers to install malware or perform other malicious manipulation on the iOS-based device.

### 2 3 Risk concentration through an Apple ID account for all Apple services

The Apple ID provides centralized access to all services provided by Apple (such as iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud, App Store, iTunes, iBook Store, iPhone Search, or Sync Services). If an unauthorized person gains access to an insufficiently secured Apple ID, they may be able to use these Apple services under a false identity, interfere with the availability of Apple ID-based services, remotely locate iOS-based devices, or reset all data, as well access information from the cloud service "iCloud". In particular, an attacker with activated iCloud backups can clone the stored data on their own iOS device.

### 2 4 Missing OS updates on old devices

There are regularly new versions of the iOS operating system and updates. These are typically provided for the latest device generation and for a number of older device generations (see Related Information). However, not all previous operating system versions are supplied with updates and security updates to the same extent. Subsequent known vulnerabilities in the operating system of an already discontinued device generation are no longer closed by updates.

### 2 5 Software vulnerabilities in apps

IOS apps can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited for local attacks or attacks over network connections. In addition, many apps are no longer maintained by third-party developers after some time. As a result, there is a risk that detected security defects will not be remedied by appropriate updates.

### 2 6 Deeper integration for pre-installed apps and their functionalities

With the operating system, Apple already delivers deeply integrated and pre-installed apps (eg the "Mail" and "Clock" apps) as well as interfaces to third-party services (such as Twitter or Facebook). Some of these apps are running with higher privileges than apps downloadable from the App Store, which increases the attack surface of the iOS-based device. The use of the non-erasable or non-configurable interfaces is usually undesirable in professional use and also increases the attack surface of the device.

### 2 7 Abuse of the fingerprint sensor

The iOS operating system includes special functions that can be easily used by the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. These are z. B. the simplified activation of the device or shopping on iTunes and the App Store. This biometric security function can be handled with the appropriate effort by replicating an artificial finger based on a digitally cleaned fingerprint. Up to 48 hours after the last entry of the set passcode, the device accepts fingerprint activation, which is the maximum time window for misuse.

### 2 8 Abuse of fitness or location data on iOS

The iOS operating system includes special functions for managing fitness and location data. These data are particularly sensitive and represent an attractive target, especially when collected and stored over a long period of time.
### 2 9 Misuse of sensitive data in the locked state

The iOS operating system has a feature to display messages from enabled widgets and push messages on the lock screen. As a result, there is a risk that sensitive information of the user unprotected on the lock screen unauthorized third parties are disclosed and can be exploited. The voice assistant Siri also provides access to phone functions and contact data even when the phone is locked. This can also lead to unauthorized third parties being able to obtain sensitive information.

### 2 10 Abuse of data stored in iOS-based devices

Because of the many features and expandability options, an iOS-based device often contains sensitive data, such as: E-mails, documents, text messages, passwords, credit card information or health information. There is a risk that these data will be abused if perpetrators reach the device in the event of loss, theft or segregation or if they obtain technical access to the data.

### 2 11 Abusive access to outsourced data

For a set of iOS-specific features, the Apple-powered infrastructure must be used. When using the iCloud Keychain, iMessage, FaceTime, Siri, Continuity, Spotlight suggestions, and iCloud features to create encrypted backups or collaborate on documents, data is always synchronized between different devices or users through Apple's infrastructure. Push messages for iOS-based devices are also routed through this infrastructure. There is therefore the danger that unauthorized persons access Apple servers and misuse the data stored or transmitted there for their own purposes.

### 2 12 Web-based attacks on browsers

Browsers, as well as many other iOS-based apps, can display web pages and web content. As a result, iOS-based devices may be affected by phishing attacks, drive-by exploits, and other web-based attacks.

### 2 13 Insufficient requirements for license management

Managing software licenses is one of the core tasks of IT compliance. Thus, there is a need for an institution to define clear responsibilities and regulations. However, the subject of licenses for apps is often not sufficiently considered. As part of overall compliance, the institution's officers must ensure that their employees do not commit a license violation.
