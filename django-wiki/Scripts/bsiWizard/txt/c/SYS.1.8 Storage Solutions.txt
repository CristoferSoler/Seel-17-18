### 1.1 Introduction

The steady growth of digital information and the increasing amount of unstructured information are leading to the use of centralized storage solutions within institutions. The requirements for such storage solutions are subject to constant change, which can be observed, for example, in the following aspects:

* The data of an institution should be available anytime, anywhere and for different application scenarios. As a result, modern storage solutions often have increased availability requirements.
* The increasing digitization of all information in an institution makes it necessary to comply with and comply with far-reaching legal requirements (compliance requirements).
* Storage solutions should be dynamically adaptable to ever-changing requirements and provide storage space centrally.
In the past, storage solutions were often implemented by connecting storage media directly to a server. However, these so-called direct-attached storage (DAS) systems often can not meet current and future requirements. Therefore, today's widespread central storage solutions and their components are necessary, which can be distinguished as follows:

* Storage solutions: A storage solution consists of one or more storage networks and at least one storage system.
* Storage networks: Storage networks allow access to the storage systems on the one hand and replication of data between storage systems on the other.
* Storage systems: A storage system is the central instance that provides space for other IT systems. A storage system also allows the simultaneous access of several IT systems to the available storage space.
### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to show how centralized storage solutions can be planned, operated and rejected safely.

### 1.3 Delimitation

In this module storage systems are considered together with the associated storage networks. Backup devices that are connected to the storage system or to the storage network are not considered here, but are treated in block OPS.1.2.2 * Archiving *. Conceptual aspects of data backup are explained in the module CON.3 * Data backup concept *. In addition, no requirements for file servers are described. These can be found in the module APP.3.3 * Fileserver *.

If external service providers are used to run a storage solution, the requirements of the module OPS.2.1 * Outsourcing for Customers * must be considered separately.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​*** *** storage solutions:

### 2 1 Lack or insufficient delineation of storage solutions

Central storage solutions increase the requirements for administration. If the responsibilities for different areas are not clearly defined, this can lead to misconfiguration. For example, if a traditional network administrator administers FC (Fiber Channel, FC) switches, he may be able to access components that he is not responsible for and not trained for. Such an operation may result in FC switches not being properly configured. This could cause important services to fail because all servers attached to the FC switches can no longer access the storage systems.

### 2 2 Unsafe default settings for memory components
Frequently, memory components are shipped with a default configuration to allow the devices to get up and running quickly with as much functionality as possible. Thus, in many devices not required functions are activated, such. HTTP, Telnet and insecure SNMP versions. If storage components with insecure factory settings are used productively, they can be accessed more easily without authorization. This can lead to z. B. Services are no longer available or unauthorized access to confidential information of the institution.

### 2 3 Manipulation of data via the storage system

An inadequately configured storage area network (SAN) can unintentionally connect networks. If, for example, a server with a SAN connection can be reached from the Internet and thus compromised from the outside, this can be used as an entry point for attackers to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the SAN. Since all security and surveillance measures such as firewalls or IDS (intrusion detection systems) can be bypassed in the IT networks of an institution in this way, the potential for damage is great.

### 2 4 Loss of confidentiality through storage-based replication methods

Storage-based replication methods have the purpose of duplicating stored or archived data in real-time over a storage network and thus additionally storing them redundantly. This is to avoid data loss. However, the automated replication of unencrypted data entails risks both in its own network and in the use of public networks: unauthorized access to legitimate replication traffic, for example by means of FC analyzers (FC replication) or sniffers (IP replication).

### 2 5 Access to information from other clients through WWN spoofing

Devices in an FC SAN are managed and assigned internally via World Wide Names (WWNs). They are somewhat the same as the MAC addresses of Ethernet network adapters. Using programs provided by the manufacturer of the Host Bus Adapter (HBA), the WWN of an HBA can be changed. This allows an attacker to access data for which he has no authorization. The manipulation of WWNs, also known as WWN spoofing, poses a considerable potential for danger for an institution. Particularly in connection with multi-tenant storage systems, unauthorized persons can access the information of other clients.

### 2 6 Overcoming the logical network separation

If the network structures of different clients are separated by virtual storage area networks (VSANs) rather than physically separate networks, this can endanger the information security of the institution. If an attacker succeeds in penetrating the network of another client, he can access both the virtual SAN of this client and the transmitted user data.

### 2 7 Failure of components of a storage solution

Complex, network-based storage solutions often consist of many components (such as FC switches, storage controllers, virtualization appliances). If components of a storage solution fail, this can lead to important applications becoming inoperable and data loss threatening.

### 2 8 Obtaining Physical Access to SAN Switches

If an institution has inadequate access and access controls to the components of a storage system or if these are completely lacking, an attacker can gain physical access to existing switches or connect additional FC SAN switches to the network. The target of the attacker could be accessing the distributed zoning database to change it so that it can access the storage systems.
