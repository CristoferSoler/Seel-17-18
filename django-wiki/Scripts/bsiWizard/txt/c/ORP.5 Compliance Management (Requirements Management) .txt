### 1.1 Introduction

In every institution there are legal, contractual, structural and internal guidelines and guidelines that have to be observed from many different directions. Many of them have a direct or indirect impact on information security management.

The requirements vary depending on industry, country and other conditions. For example, an authority is subject to other external regulations than a stock corporation. The management level of the institution must ensure compliance with the requirements (New German: Compliance) and operate a compliance management system.

Depending on the size of an institution, it may have different management processes that deal with different aspects of risk management, such as: Security management, privacy management, compliance management, controlling. They should work together in a spirit of trust in order to exploit synergy effects and resolve conflicts at an early stage.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of the module Compliance Management is to show how an overview of the various requirements of the individual areas of an institution can be created at any time. It describes how security requirements can be derived from legal, contractual, structural and internal guidelines and specifications.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module looks at selected requirements that result from legal or contractual requirements and that have an impact on the design of information security in the institution. It does not address sectoral laws.

-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in compliance management:

### 2 1 Violation of legal requirements

The inadequate implementation of information security can lead to violations of legal regulations or contractual agreements. In addition, institutions must observe a multitude of sector-specific, national and international legal framework conditions. Since this can be very complex, it can happen that unintentional violates legal requirements or this is even deliberately accepted. Example:

* Many cloud service providers offer their services in an international environment. Thus, the providers are often subject to other national laws. Often, cloud users only see at low costs and estimate the legal framework to be complied with, such as data protection, information requirements, insolvency law, liability, information access for third parties.
### 2 2 Improper disclosure of information

Due to the misconduct of persons, it may happen that information worth protecting is inadmissible. Examples for this are:

* Confidential information is discussed within earshot of other people, for example, during breaks in meetings or via mobile phones in public environments.
* The manager of a department suspects an employee to work with the competition. To prove this to him, he asks the head of IT operations to give him "on the small way" insight into the emails of this employee. The IT operations manager instructs the mail administrator to set up access for this without obtaining the necessary consents.
### 2 3 Inadequate identification check of communication partners
In personal conversations, on the phone or even in e-mails, many people are willing to divulge much more information than they would in writing or in large groups. Often the communication partner is tacitly expected to treat the conversation or e-mail content confidentially. In addition, there is a tendency not to question the identity of the communication partner, as this is perceived as rude. Likewise, permissions are often not checked sufficiently, but implicitly derived from the (claimed) role. Typical examples are:

* An employee receives an e-mail from an alleged acquaintance of his supervisor, allegedly agreeing to the fast transfer of an outstanding amount.
* A man in a blue jacket with a mounting case gains access to the data center after mumbling something about "water pipes".
### 2 4 Accidental disclosure of internal information

When passing on information, it happens again and again that in addition to the desired information inadvertently also other information is transmitted. This may result in confidential, appropriate information falling into the wrong hands. examples for this are

* old files or residual information on shared media, transmission of data other than intended or sent to wrong recipients.
* In 2015, a French TV station was unable to broadcast a program for hours after hackers gained access to internal IT systems. In a press conference, after the station was able to work again, a notice board was transmitted in the background around the world, where passwords for all sorts of internal and external identifiers hung.
