### 1.1 Introduction

An office space is the area within an institution where one or more employees are located to perform their duties. This module describes the typical threats and requirements for information security for an office room.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of the module is to protect the information that is processed in offices.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module considers technical and non-technical security requirements for office space. Recommendations on how to configure and secure the IT systems in these rooms are not covered in this module. Hints are u. a. in SYS.2.1 * General Client * as well as in the operating system-specific blocks.

Also on the wiring of offices is not discussed. To do this, the components INF.3 * Electrotechnical cabling * and INF.4 * IT cabling * must be considered separately. Requirements for fire protection and access control in buildings can be found in building block INF.1 * General building *.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the field of * * office space:

### 2 1 Unauthorized access

If access controls are lacking or insufficient, unauthorized persons can enter an office room and steal sensitive data, steal devices or manipulate them. This may affect the availability, confidentiality, or integrity of devices and information. Even if no immediate damage can be detected, the operation can be disrupted by the fact that it must be investigated how such an incident was possible, whether damage has occurred or tampering.

### 2 2 Impairment due to unfavorable working conditions

An office space that is not ergonomically designed or an unfavorable working environment can result in employees not working undisturbed or being unable to use the IT that is used optimally. The disturbances range from noise or heavy traffic to unfavorable lighting and poor ventilation. As a result, work processes are restricted and employee potential is used insufficiently. There may also be errors in the work, which may reduce the integrity of data.

### 2 3 Cleaning and external staff or visitors

For smaller or short meetings, it is usually more efficient to receive a visit to the office. Visitors as well as cleaners and third-party personnel can view internal information in various ways, endanger business processes and manipulate IT systems, from improper handling of technical equipment to attempts to "play" IT systems to theft of documents or IT components. For example, by cleaning personnel accidentally a plug connection can be solved or water get into the IT, even documents can be misplaced or even disposed of with the waste.

### 2 4 Manipulation or destruction of IT, accessories, information and software in the office

Attackers can try to manipulate or destroy IT systems, accessories, and other data carriers for a variety of reasons. Attacks can be all the more effective the later they are discovered by the employee or the institution itself, the more extensive the knowledge of the perpetrators and the more profound the consequences for a job. The manipulations range from the unauthorized inspection of the employee's sensitive data to the destruction of data carriers or IT systems. Significant downtime and process limitations can be the result.

### 2 5 Theft
As IT devices become more manageable, it's easier to pocket them unnoticed. The theft of data carriers, IT systems, accessories, software or data incurs reimbursement costs and the restoration of a workable state, as well as losses due to a lack of availability. In addition, the person who stole the IT equipment could view and disclose sensitive information, which could lead to further damage. In many cases, these weigh considerably heavier than the mere material loss of the device.

In addition to expensive IT systems, mobile devices are often stolen, which can be transported inconspicuously and easily. If the office space is not locked, supervised or the IT systems are not sufficiently secured, the technology can be stolen accordingly quickly and inconspicuously.

### 2 6 Flying cabling

Depending on the location of the connection points of the sockets, the power supply and the data network in the office room, cables could be routed across the room, even across traffic routes. Such "flying" cables are not just tripping hazards that can injure people. If people get stuck, it can also damage IT equipment.

### 2 7 Vandalism

Vandalism destroys or damages foreign property. The effects are very similar to those of an attack, only that vandalism is not deliberately planned and implemented like this, but is usually the expression of spontaneous, blind destructive rage. Both external perpetrators (disappointed burglars) and culprits (frustrated or mentally unstable staff) are eligible. Possible triggers for vandalism may include disagreements, personal problems, bullying or a bad working atmosphere.

3 requirements
---------------

The following are specific requirements for office protection. Basically, the Information Security Officer (ISB) is responsible for meeting the requirements. Deviations from this are mentioned separately in the corresponding requirements. The ISB should always be involved in strategic decisions. He is also responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy.
