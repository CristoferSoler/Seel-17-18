### 1.1 Introduction

Good network coverage and powerful IT equipment, such as: For example, laptops, smartphones or tablets allow employees to work almost anywhere, from anywhere. This means that official tasks are often performed not only in the rooms and buildings of the institution, but in changing workplaces in different environments, eg. In hotel rooms, trains or at customers. The information processed must be adequately protected.

On the one hand, mobile work changes the duration, location, and distribution of working hours, and on the other hand, it increases information security requirements because mobile workplace environments can not assume the security of an IT infrastructure found in an office environment.

### 1.2 Objective

The module describes security requirements for mobile workstations. The aim is to create a security situation comparable to an office space for such workplaces.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module contains fundamental requirements that must be observed and fulfilled when employees often work not only within the premises of the institution, but at changing workplaces outside.

Above all, it depicts the organizational, technical and personnel requirements for wholly or partially mobile work. In order to secure IT systems, data media or documents used in mobile work, all relevant components must be used, such as SYS.3.1 * laptop *, SYS.3.2 * tablet and smartphone, * SYS.3.4 * mobile data carrier, * NET .3.3 * VPN, * SYS.2.1 * Common Client, INF.1 Building or INF.8 Home Workplace * are considered separately.

Likewise, the security requirements for VDU workplaces that are fixed by the employer (teleworking) are not the subject of this module, but are described in OPS.1.2.4 * Teleworking *.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the * * mobile workspace area:

### 2 1 Lack of or inadequate regulations for mobile workplaces

If the mobile work is not or only insufficiently regulated, the institution may incur financial damages. If, for example, it is not regulated which information may be transported and processed outside of the institution and which safeguards must be adhered to, confidential information can get into the wrong hands. These may then be used by unauthorized persons to the serious disadvantage of the institution.

### 2 2 Impaired by changing operating environment

Because mobile data carriers and end devices are used in very different environments, they are exposed to a variety of threats. These include, for example, damaging environmental influences (for example, high or too low temperatures), as well as dust, moisture or transport damage.

In addition to these influences, the operating environments with their different levels of security must be taken into account. Especially smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar mobile devices are not only mobile, but can also communicate with other IT systems. In this case, for example, malicious programs can be transmitted or sensitive information can be copied. In this way, tasks may no longer be fulfilled, customer appointments may not be performed, or IT systems may be damaged.

### 2 3 Manipulation or destruction of IT systems, accessories, information and software on the mobile workstation
It may be easier to manipulate or destroy IT systems, accessories, information and software that are used on a mobile device than in the institution. The mobile workstation is often accessible to third parties. Also here the central protective measures of the institution are not present, for example, porter services. If IT systems, accessories, information or software are manipulated or destroyed, the employee at the mobile workstation is often only able to work to a limited extent. In addition, destroyed IT components or software solutions may need to be replaced, which requires both financial and time resources.

### 2 4 Delays due to temporarily limited accessibility

Most employees at the mobile workstation have no fixed working hours and are sometimes difficult to reach on the way. This can significantly delay the flow of information. Even if the information is transmitted via e-mail, the response time is not necessarily shortened because it can not be guaranteed that the mobile employee will read the e-mail in a timely manner. Depending on the situation and institution, temporary accessibility has different effects, but it can severely limit the availability of information.

### 2 5 Unsecured file and disk transport

When documents, data carriers or files are transported between the institution and the mobile workstations, this information and data can be lost or stolen, read or manipulated by unauthorized third parties. As a result, the institution may incur greater financial damages. File and disk transport can be insufficiently secured in several ways:

* If unique items are transported (missing backup), goals and tasks can not be achieved as planned after loss.
* If unencrypted data carriers fall into the wrong hands, this can lead to serious confidentiality losses.
* If there is insufficient access protection on the way, files or data carriers can be copied or manipulated unnoticed.
### 2 6 Inappropriate disposal of data media and documents

If it is not possible to properly dispose of data media and documents at the mobile workstation, these usually go into the household waste. Even where work is being done on the move, employees often throw drafts and other supposedly useless documents directly into the next wastebasket or simply leave them lying in the hotel or on the train. However, if data carriers or documents are not properly disposed of, attackers can derive valuable information that can be deliberately misused for blackmail or industrial espionage. The consequences range from the loss of know-how to the threat to the existence of the institution, for example, if important orders fail to materialize or partnerships fail.

### 2 7 Confidentiality loss of sensitive information

At the mobile workstation, attackers can more easily access sensitive information stored on hard drives, removable media, or paper, especially if they are professional. They can also listen to communication links. However, if information is read or disclosed unauthorized, it will have serious consequences for the entire institution. Among other things, the loss of confidentiality may result in the institution violating laws or creating competitive disadvantages and financial loss.

### 2 8 Theft or loss of data carriers or documents

The mobile workstation is not as well secured as the workplace in a company or agency. During a train journey, from a hotel room or sometimes also from conference rooms to customers, it is easier to steal official IT and documents.
In addition, IT systems or components can be lost. In addition to the purely material damage caused by the immediate loss of the mobile device, the disclosure of sensitive data (eg e-mails, notes from meetings, addresses or other documents) may result in further (financial and / or reputational) damage.

### 2 9 Lack of security awareness and carelessness in handling information

Often it can be observed that organizational regulations and technical security measures for portable IT systems and mobile data carriers exist in institutions, but these are again undermined by the careless handling of specifications and technology. So z. B. repeatedly observed that brought along mobile data carriers are left unattended in the meeting room or in the train compartment during breaks.

In addition, gifts in the form of data carriers, such as. As USB sticks, accepted by employees and thoughtlessly connected to your own notebook. Here then the notebook can be infected with malware and thereby protected information can be stolen, manipulated or encrypted and thus made temporarily unusable.

In public transport or during business lunches, it can be observed again and again that people are having open discussions about business-critical information. These can then easily be overheard by outsiders and may be used to the grave disadvantage of the employee or his institution.
