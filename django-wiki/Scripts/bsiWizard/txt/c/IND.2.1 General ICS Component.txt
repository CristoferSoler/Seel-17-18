### 1.1 Introduction

An ICS component is an electronic component that controls or regulates a machine or plant. It is thus part of an industrial control system (English: Industrial Control System, ICS) or more generally an operational technology (English: Operational Technology, OT). Such components may be Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors, actuators, a machine, or other parts of an ICS.

Due to the high availability requirements typical in the OT environment and the often extreme environmental conditions (climate, dust, vibration, corrosion), ICS components have always been designed as robust devices with high reliability and a long service life.

ICS components are usually configured or programmed using special software from the respective manufacturer. This is done either via so-called programming devices (eg as an application under Windows or Linux) or via an engineering station which loads the application programs into the programmable logic controllers.

The role of the Information Security Officer in the field of industrial automation varies according to the nature and direction of the institution. Another name besides ICS Information Security Officer (ICS-ISB) is also Industrial Security Officer.

### 1.2 Objective

The goal of the device is to protect all types of ICS components, regardless of manufacturer, type, purpose and location. It can be used for a single device or a multi-component modular device.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The requirements are developed for a generic component. For more specific ICS components, additional building blocks are available under IND.2 * ICS Components * that describe requirements that go beyond the generic requirements of this building block and may need to be implemented.

The module contains no organizational requirements for securing an ICS component. For this, the requirements of the block IND.1 * Operating and Control Technology * must be implemented.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the General ICS Component area:

### 2 1 Damage caused by harmful environmental influences

ICS components in industrial environments are often exposed to special conditions that may affect safe operation. Examples include extreme heat, cold, moisture, dust, vibration or corrosive or corrosive atmospheres. Frequently, several factors occur simultaneously. Such adverse environmental conditions can cause ICS components to wear faster and fail earlier.

### 2 2 Incomplete documentation

ICS components are often incompletely documented, so not all product features are known. Information about the services used, protocols and communication ports as well as authorization management are often particularly incomplete. This makes the hazard analysis more difficult because interfaces, functions and security-relevant mechanisms are overlooked. As a result, potential hazards can not be taken into account. In addition, there are no or limited responses to new vulnerabilities in an ICS component if the services and ports used are not fully captured.

### 2 3 Insecure system configuration

The standard configuration of ICS components is often designed to allow the components to function properly and be easy to commission. Security mechanisms often do not play a sufficient role. By default, all services, protocols, and ports are often turned on and remain active even when they are not in use. Likewise, default permissions often remain unchanged.
It is easy for attackers to take over and manipulate such components. It is also possible for an attacker to exploit the insecure system configuration to use the ICS component as a starting point for further attacks. As a result, business-critical information can flow away or the entire operation of the institution can be affected.

### 2 4 Insufficient user and authorization management

Some ICS components have their own user and permission management. If this is poorly designed, it can happen that employees share user accounts or that the permissions of departed employees or service providers are not deleted. Overall, unauthorized persons can access ICS components.

### 2 5 Insufficient logging

For ICS components, logging is often limited to process-related events. Information relevant to information security is often not recorded. As a result, security incidents are difficult to detect and can not be reconstructed afterwards.

### 2 6 Manipulation and sabotage of an ICS component

The multiple interfaces of ICS components lead to an increased risk of manipulation of systems, software and transmitted information. Depending on the motivation and knowledge of the perpetrator, this can have an impact locally, but also across all locations. In addition, status and alarm messages or other measured values ​​can be suppressed or changed.

Manipulated readings can lead to incorrect decisions of ICS components or operating personnel. Manipulated systems can be used to attack other systems or sites or to cover up ongoing manipulation.

### 2 7 Use of unsafe protocols

Some of the protocols used in the field of industrial control systems offer no or only limited security mechanisms. Technical information such as measurement and control values ​​are often transmitted in plain text and without integrity assurance or authentication. An attacker with access to the transmission medium can then read out and modify the contents of the communication or introduce control commands, thereby provoking actions or directly influencing the operation. A protocol-level attack is possible even if the ICS component is otherwise securely configured and does not itself have vulnerabilities.

### 2 8 denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

An attacker could interfere with the operation of ICS components by DoS attacks. For processes running under real-time conditions, even a shorter disruption can lead to loss of information or control.

### 2 9 malware

The threat posed by malicious programs is also becoming increasingly severe in industrial control systems. Infection opportunities arise through interfaces to the outside world and office IT (vertical integration) but also through mobile devices such as service notebooks or removable storage devices in the programming and maintenance of ICS components. By the latter malicious programs can also be introduced into isolated environments (overcoming the "air gap").

### 2 10 Spying on information

ICS components often contain detailed information about the controlled or monitored process or process. Also from other transmitted values, such as measurement or control data, this information can be partially reconstructed. The same applies to control programs or parameters.

Attackers could get business secrets here (industrial espionage), eg. Recipes, procedures or other intellectual property. They can also gain information about the functioning of an ICS component and its security mechanisms, which can be used for further attacks.

### 2 11 Insufficient security requirements for procurement
Due to a lack of awareness of the risks and cost reasons, procurement often does not take information security into account. As a result, ICS components can sometimes contain serious vulnerabilities that can only be remedied later on.

### 2 12 Manipulated firmware

For ICS components, the operating system (firmware) can be changed in addition to the application program. This allows manipulated software to enter the system. The internal memory could be altered by a compromised programmer, through a local data interface (eg, USB), or through another existing network connection by an attacker. Similarly, a software update could have been manipulated on the way from the manufacturer to the operator. Finally, a component with already compromised firmware could arrive at the operator, such as a manipulated supply chain or purchasing from insecure sources. This gives an attacker the opportunity to change or distort processes and procedures.
