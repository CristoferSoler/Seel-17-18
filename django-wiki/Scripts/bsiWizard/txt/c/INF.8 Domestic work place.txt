### 1.1 Introduction

Teleworkers, freelancers or the self-employed typically work from home-based workplaces. In contrast to the workplace in an office environment, employees at a home workplace * * use a workplace in their own living environment. It must be made possible that the professional sphere is sufficiently separated from the private sphere. If employees use domestic jobs on a permanent basis, various legal requirements must be met, for example, the workplaces must comply with occupational health and ergonomic regulations.

A home-based workplace can not assume the same infrastructural security as is found in the offices of an institution. For example, often the workplace is also accessible to visitors or family members. Therefore, measures must be taken to achieve a level of security comparable to an office space.

### 1.2 Objective

This module shows how the infrastructure of a home-based workplace can be safely set up and operated. The core objective of the module is to protect the information of the institution at the home workplace.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module contains basic requirements that must be observed and fulfilled in order to be able to counteract specific hazards to a home-based workplace. However, only specific infrastructure requirements for a fixed workplace with access by third parties are defined. However, security requirements for the IT systems used (eg computers) and in particular for the technical components of teleworking (eg communication links) are not the subject of this module but are described in OPS.1.2.4 * Telework * and described in the respective system-specific building blocks.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance to a home-based workplace:

### 2 1 Lack of or inadequate regulations for the home office

Since a home-based workplace is located outside the institution, the employees there are largely on their own. As a result, lack of or inadequate regulations for the home-based workplace environment can create IT issues with increased downtime. For example, if IT issues can not be resolved remotely, an IT supervisor from the institution will first have to go to the home office to fix the problem. If the handling of internal and confidential information at the home office is not comprehensibly regulated, it could happen that employees keep this information wrong. This may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the information, as it can not sufficiently prevent information from being spied out or modified.

### 2 2 Unauthorized access to vulnerable areas of the home workplace

Rooms in a home-based workplace where sensitive information is kept and processed, or where vulnerable equipment is placed, become vulnerable spaces. If unauthorized persons can enter these rooms unattended, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data and information located there is considerably jeopardized.

** Examples **

* An employee had set up a separate study at home but did not complete it consistently. When the toddlers were left unattended, they played in the unfastened study. Important documents were used as a basis for painting.
* When a coworker at the domestic workplace was engrossed in a project work, he got a surprising visit. While he was making coffee in the kitchen, the visitor wanted to do some quick research on the computer while the computer was not locked up and inadvertently infected it with malicious software.
### 2 3 Impairment of IT use due to unfavorable working conditions at the home workplace

A non-ergonomic home-based workplace or an unfavorable working environment can result in undisturbed work or a lack of optimal use of IT. The disturbances range from noise or heavy traffic to unfavorable lighting and poor ventilation. As a result, work processes are restricted and employee potential is used insufficiently. There may also be errors in the work, the integrity of data can be reduced.

### 2 4 Unsecured file and disk transport

When documents, media or files are transported between the institution and the home office, there is a risk that this data and information will be lost or stolen, read or manipulated by unauthorized third parties. File and disk transport can be insufficiently secured in several ways:

* If unique items are transported (missing backup), goals and tasks can not be achieved as planned after loss.
* If unencrypted data carriers fall into the wrong hands, this can lead to serious confidentiality losses.
* If insufficient access protection is available on the way, files or data carriers can be copied or manipulated unnoticed.
### 2 5 Unsuitable disposal of data media and documents

If employees at the domestic workplace are not able to dispose of data media and documents properly, there is a risk that they will be thrown into the household waste. However, attackers can gain valuable information that can be misused specifically for blackmail or industrial espionage. The consequences range from the loss of know-how to the threat to the existence of the institution, for example, if important orders fail to materialize or partnerships fail.

### 2 6 Manipulation or destruction of IT, accessories, information and software at the home office

IT equipment, accessories, information, and software used at the home workplace may be easier to manipulate or destroy than at the institution. The home office is often accessible to customers, relatives and family visitors. Also here the central protective measures of the institution are not present, for example, porter services. When manipulating or destroying IT equipment, accessories, information, or software, employees often have limited ability to work at home. In addition, it may be necessary to replace destroyed IT components, information and software solutions, which requires both financial and time resources.

### 2 7 Danger by cleaning or external personnel

Cleaning and contracting personnel can jeopardize internal information, business processes and IT systems in various ways, ranging from improper handling of technical equipment, through attempts to "play" IT systems, to theft of documents or IT components. For example, by cleaning personnel accidentally a plug connection can be solved, get water in the IT, documents laid or even removed with the waste.

### 2 8 Increased theft risk at the home workplace
The home office is usually not as well secured as the workplace in a company or agency. By more elaborate precautions (eg security doors, porter service), the danger of someone entering the building unauthorized is much lower than in a private home. Burglars mostly steal items that are quick and easy to sell. It can also be stolen official IT. However, the information available on the stolen official IT systems often has a higher value than the IT systems themselves. Burglars could try to obtain a higher profit by extorting or distributing the data to competing companies than by selling the hardware.

3 requirements
---------------

The following are specific requirements for the protection of the home workplace. Basically, the employee is responsible for meeting the requirements. The Information Security Officer (ISB) should always be involved in strategic decisions. In addition, the ISB is responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy. In addition, there may be other roles that have additional responsibilities in the implementation of requirements. These are then listed explicitly in square brackets in the heading of the respective requirements.

### 3.1 Basic requirements

The following requirements MUST be implemented as a priority:

#### INF.8.A1 Securing official documents at the home office

Official documents and data carriers MUST be stored in the home office in such a way that no unauthorized persons can access them. Therefore, there must be sufficient closable containers (desk, roll container, cabinet, etc.). Each employee MUST leave his / her domestic workplace tidy and ensure that no sensitive information is freely accessible.

#### INF.8.A2 Transportation of work material to the home workplace [Home automation]

It MUST be regulated which data carriers and documents are processed at the home office and transported between the institution and the home office. In general, data carriers and other documents MUST be transported safely. The regulations MUST be appropriately communicated to the employees.

#### INF.8.A3 Protection against unauthorized access to the home workplace [Home automation]

The employees MUST be informed about the regulations and measures for burglary and access protection. MUST be warned to close windows and lock doors when the home office is empty.

It MUST be ensured that unauthorized persons can never enter the home office and access company IT and documents. These measures MUST be checked at reasonable intervals, or at least a change in domestic circumstances.

### 3.2 Standard requirements

Together with the basic requirements, the following requirements are in line with the state of the art in the field of home work. They SHOULD be implemented in principle.

#### INF.8.A4 Adequate home-work equipment [Home automation]

The home office SHOULD be separated from the private areas of the home by a suitable layout.

The home workplace SHOULD have a suitable device that meets the ergonomic requirements.

Similarly, the home workplace should be protected from burglary by appropriate technical safeguards. The protective measures SHOULD be adapted to the local conditions and the existing protection requirements.

#### INF.8.A5 Disposal of confidential information at the home workplace [Home automation]
Confidential information SHOULD be safely disposed of, so do not just throw it in the trash. In a special safety guideline SHOULD be regulated, how to remove sensitive material. The required disposal facilities SHOULD be available.

### 3.3 Requirements for increased protection requirements

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that exceed the state of the art level of protection and should be considered IN THE EVENT OF INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### INF.8.A6 Dealing with official documents in case of increased need for protection at home [Information Security Officer (ISB)] (CIA)

If employees are required to process official documents or information with increased protection needs, they should consider giving up work at home. Otherwise, the home workplace SHOULD be protected by advanced, high quality technical safeguards.
