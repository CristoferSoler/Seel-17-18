### 1.1 Introduction

Remote maintenance refers to spatially separate access to IT systems and the applications running on them for configuration, maintenance, repair or control purposes. Remote maintenance can be done passively by an exclusively viewing access to the IT system or applications, or actively through direct administrative intervention in the operating system or running applications. In the case of passive remote maintenance, a user on site must perform the actual actions under the guidance of an administrator. In the case of active remote maintenance, on the other hand, an operating system is intervened and operated directly by an administrator. Among other things, the signals of a mouse and keyboard commands, as well as screen contents and console outputs are transmitted. Even if effective mechanisms for securing remote access access are implemented, there is direct access from outside to the internal network and data processed therein. Through these interfaces, external parties can endanger the institution and thus cause economic and operational damage.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of the module is to protect information stored, processed and transmitted based on remote maintenance. For this purpose, requirements are made for the remote maintenance, which relate to functions of active and passive remote maintenance.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module looks at remote maintenance from the point of view of IT operation and provides advice for users on how remote maintenance can be used. The holistic guarantee of information security in all phases of the lifecycle is important. The security aspects of the communication connections used, authentication mechanisms and the protection of the remote maintenance access are important components of the module. In the context of the component "remote monitoring", not all relevant aspects of the related business processes are covered. Therefore, aspects of the modules * OPS.1.1.3 Patch and Change Management *, * ORP.3 Sensitization and Training, CON.1 Crypto Concept * and CON.3 * Data Backup Concept * must be guaranteed separately. Likewise, the specifications of the component layers NET (networks and communication), DER (detection & reaction), the components of the layer * OPS.2 IT operation of third parties * and the components of the layer * OPS.3 IT operation for third parties * have been implemented which are directly related to remote administration. For cloud-based products, the building block * OPS.2.2 cloud usage * must be taken into account. Likewise, the Remote Procedure Calls of Windows 2010 are not part of this document.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the field of remote maintenance:

### 2 1 Inadequate knowledge of remote maintenance regulations

If the parties know insufficiently about important regulations and therefore do not apply them, the protection of the information in the context of a remote maintenance is endangered. Therefore, there are dangers for the IT operation, if current regulations are not made public. In particular, administrators who set up and use remote maintenance, are on regulations, eg. As to configurations, instructed, otherwise with the remote maintenance additional operational risks, but also security gaps to the internal network arise and attacks on the remote maintenance can not be detected or fended off.

### 2 2 Missing or inadequate planning and control of remote maintenance
If remote maintenance is not carefully planned, set up and regulated, not only the security of an IT system but of all IT systems of an institution can be impaired if vulnerabilities are exploited. Vulnerabilities can arise in many places and affect communication protocols, patching processes, encryption algorithms and authentication mechanisms. Insufficiently secured remote maintenance interfaces can also compromise a linked network of a third party.

### 2 3 Unauthorized exercise of rights in remote maintenance

Access, access and access permissions tailored to each task are used to protect information, business processes and IT systems from unauthorized access. If such authorizations are granted to unauthorized persons during remote maintenance, or if rights are exercised unauthorized remotely, a large number of threats to the confidentiality and integrity of data and the availability of such data may arise. B. of computing power. Possible damage scenarios include, for example, the introduction of malicious software, the manipulation of data and information, and the unauthorized gathering of information. Impact can z. For example, financial and knowledge losses, physical destruction of physical assets and compromises of IT systems and networks.

### 2 4 Unsuitable use of authentication for remote maintenance

In the remote maintenance authentication mechanisms are used, which are based on a user management with stored authentication data. If unauthorized third parties gain administrative authorizations on remote maintenance computers or for remote maintenance tools, the institution may incur far-reaching damage. These include z. These include unauthorized configurations of IT systems and applications, compromises, and information and data loss.

### 2 5 Insecure and uncontrolled establishment of communication links

For remote maintenance, access to communication interfaces of the administered computer is generally required. This always includes a potential hazard.

Likewise, communication interfaces of IT systems are not always obvious to the user, which is additionally transmitted in addition to user and protocol information. A manipulated or even activated communication interface may under some circumstances be established without initiation by a user to connect to a remote station or be addressed by a third party to a function not known to the user.

### 2 6 Faulty remote maintenance

Ensuring the security and viability of remote-access IT systems and applications requires professional and ongoing remote maintenance. If these IT systems and applications are not properly configured, maintained, repaired, and monitored remotely, they can not be used at worst. If errors occur within the remote maintenance processes, malfunctions of individual operating system functions can directly result from this. In addition, late or faulty IT system maintenance can cause security vulnerabilities.

### 2 7 Use of unsafe protocols in remote maintenance

Communication via public and internal networks via insecure protocols poses a potential danger. For example, if legacy versions of IPSec, SSH, or SSL / TLS are used to establish a tunnel between two endpoints or networks, the security of these tunnels can not be adequately ensured. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in these protocols to inject their own content into protected connections. Generally considered to be unsecure protocols, where information is transmitted in plain text.

### 2 8 Inappropriate handling of authentication procedures for remote maintenance
The security of an authentication process is directly dependent on the careful handling of it. The disclosure of user-supplied authentication data and the insecure storage of this information pose a potential danger. There may be security vulnerabilities for unauthorized access to the rights and role profiles of administrators as well as IT systems and applications.

### 2 9 Unsafe cryptographic algorithms for remote maintenance

There is a loss of security within the remote maintenance, if insecure cryptographic methods used or secret keys are not sufficiently protected. Negligence in the field of cryptographic algorithms can lead to compromises of cryptographic keys. In addition, attackers can more easily penetrate if they can analyze or break the cryptographic process with reasonable time and technical resources and then penetrate into the communication.

### 2 10 Insecure and uncontrolled external use of remote maintenance access

Unauthorized persons or third parties are allowed to use the components of the remote maintenance without a contractual basis, eg. If authorization concepts of the institution are bypassed or not carefully implemented, the security of remote maintenance, IT systems and applications is no longer guaranteed.

### 2 11 Use of online services for remote maintenance

In addition to remote maintenance, in which an administrator establishes a direct data connection to the institution to be administered, so-called online services can also be used. Here, the IT systems to be administrated connect to the servers of a third-party provider and the administrators can access the IT systems to be administered via a web browser or similar.

Since the communication is not encrypted end-to-end and access takes place via a third party, the data exchange could be read directly. In addition, the IT systems could also be administered by unauthorized persons by changing the data connection. If the IT systems automatically establish a data connection to the online service at system startup and the access data are known, the IT system could be accessed directly.

In order to establish a connection to the online service, often no administrative rights to the IT systems to be administered are needed, the administrator then only needs one browser. Users without administrative rights can thus initiate remote access unauthorized.
