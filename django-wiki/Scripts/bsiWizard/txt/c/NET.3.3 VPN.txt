### 1.1 Introduction

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can be used to implement security measures to transfer sensitive data over non-trusted networks, such as the Internet. A VPN is a network that is physically operated within another network, such as the Internet, but is logically disconnected from that network. VPNs can use cryptographic techniques to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data. The secure authentication of the communication partners is also possible if several networks or computers are connected via leased lines or public networks.

### 1.2 Objective

The module defines requirements with which a VPN can be purposefully and safely planned, implemented and operated.

### 1.3 Delimitation

A VPN in terms of this building block is a network that is physically operated within another network, but is logically disconnected from that network. The VPN building block does not address the basics for secure networks (see NET.1.1 * Network architecture and design *). Nor does it cover all processes related to the operation of a VPN. In particular, the building blocks OPS.1.1.3 * Patch and Change Management *, ORP.3 * Information Security and Training *, CON.1 * Crypto Concept *, OPS.1.1.5 * Data Backup *, DER.4 * Emergency Management * and OPS.2.4 * Remote Maintenance * g.

The module must be used for every type of remote access to the information network. These include connections via data networks, such as site-to-site, end-to-end or remote access VPNs, and via telecommunications links, such as analog dial-up, ISDN or cellular phones. This module only covers VPN systems for layers 2 (data link layer) to 4 (transport layer) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

Recommendations on how to configure the operating systems of the VPN endpoints are also not part of this module. Corresponding requirements can be found in the block SYS.1.1 * General Server * or SYS.2.1 * General Client * as well as the respective operating system-specific blocks of the IT-Grundschutz Compendium.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​VPN:

### 2 1 Lacking or inadequate planning and regulation of VPN deployment

If the VPN is not carefully planned, set up, or configured, security vulnerabilities may occur that affect all IT systems networked to the VPN. Attackers may thus be able to access confidential information of the institution.

For example, with inadequate VPN scheduling and regimentation, it is possible that users were not properly trained, thereby using the VPN in an insecure environment or dialing in from an insecure client. This may allow attackers to access the entire corporate network.

Even if the regular monitoring of access to the VPN was inadequately planned, attacks could not be detected in time. Thus, it is not possible to react promptly and an attacker can steal data unnoticed or sabotage entire processes.

### 2 2 Insecure VPN service providers

VPN connections can reach into critical areas of the network. If the institution uses a VPN service provider and has not chosen it carefully, this could make the entire network of the institution unsafe. For example, an insecure VPN service offered by attackers could be used by attackers to steal targeted information.

### 2 3 Problems with local storage of authentication data for VPNs
Many VPN clients for remote access allow the data required for authentication to be saved locally so that the user does not have to enter them again when reconnecting. If an attacker succeeds in gaining access to the VPN client, he may be able to read access data and log in to the network as a legitimate user. Thus, he can access the local networks and the information and services of the institution that can be accessed therein.

### 2 4 Insecure configuration of VPN clients for remote access

If a VPN client is not configured securely, users could use their security mechanisms incorrectly or not at all. Also, they may change the configuration of the client. It is also possible by an insecure configuration that software installed by the user also endangers the security of the VPN client.

### 2 5 Insecure default settings on VPN components

The default settings of VPN components do not always have all the features of a secure installation. Often more attention is paid to usability and ease of integration with existing systems than security. If VPN components are not or only insufficiently adapted to the specific security needs of the institution, weak points and thus dangerous points of attack can arise. For example, the entire VPN and thus the internal network of the institution is vulnerable if the manufacturer does not change the default passwords.

### 2 6 Theft of mobile devices with VPN client

Mobile devices are often stolen or otherwise lost. As a result, the danger exists that attackers can access the institution's internal network via the VPN connection established there. Often missing loss reporting processes, so z. For example, if a stolen laptop is not promptly reported to the correct location in the institution. As a result, the attacker may have long been unnoticed in the internal network and copy numerous information worthy of protection.
