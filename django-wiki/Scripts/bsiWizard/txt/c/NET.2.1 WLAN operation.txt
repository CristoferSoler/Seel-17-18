### 1.1 Introduction

Wireless LANs (WLANs) can be used to set up wireless local area networks or extend existing wired networks. To date, almost all WLAN components available on the market are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its additions. A special role is played by the manufacturer consortium Wi-Fi Alliance, which has created an industry standard based on the IEEE 802.11 standard with "Wi-Fi". The Wi-Fi Alliance confirms with the Wi-Fi seal of approval that a device has passed certain interoperability and conformance tests.

Due to the usually simple installation, WLANs are also used to temporarily set up networks, for example at trade fairs or smaller events. In addition, in public places, such as airports or train stations, network access via so-called hotspots can be offered. This allows mobile users to connect to the Internet or their corporate network. Communication then generally takes place between a central access point, the access point, and the WLAN component of the terminal (for example via a WLAN USB stick or an integrated WLAN function).

### 1.2 Objective

This module aims to systematically show how WLANs can be safely set up and operated in an institution.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module contains basic requirements that must be observed and fulfilled when setting up and operating WLANs. Requirements for secure use of WLANs are not the subject of this module. Secure use of WLANs is covered in the NET.2.2 * WLAN usage * block. Likewise, the operation of hotspots (see NET.2.3 * Operation of hotspots *) is not discussed here.

WLANs can be operated in two different modes according to the needs of an operator and the hardware equipment available. In ad hoc mode, two or more mobile devices equipped with a wireless network card communicate directly with each other. Since WLANs in ad-hoc mode can build up and configure independently, ie without fixed infrastructure, and thus establish a fully meshed parallel network infrastructure, the ad hoc mode is unsuitable in an environment to be protected. This will not be considered further below. In most cases, WLANs operate in infrastructure mode, which means H. the communication of the clients and the connection to wired LAN segments takes place via the access point.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​WLAN operation:

### 2 1 Failure or malfunction of a wireless network

In radio networks, information is transmitted by means of electromagnetic radio waves. If other electromagnetic sources in the same frequency spectrum emit energy, they can interfere with wireless communication and in extreme cases prevent the operation of the WLAN. This can be caused by other radio systems and devices, such as Bluetooth, microwave ovens or other wireless networks. In addition, denial-of-service attacks are possible. For example, sending certain control and management signals repeatedly may cause the wireless network to become unavailable.

### 2 2 Missing or inadequate planning of the WLAN deployment

Planning errors often turn out to be particularly serious, since it is easy to create comprehensive security gaps. If the use of WLANs is not or insufficiently planned, a variety of problems can arise, such as the following:

* Confidential data could be read, for example if WLAN standards are used that are no longer state-of-the-art (eg WEP for encryption).
* The transmission capacity may be insufficient. As a result, bandwidth-intensive applications can not be used with the required quality of service.
### 2 3 Missing or inadequate regulations for WLAN use

In the case of a WLAN infrastructure that is not centrally administered, the access points in the default setting are usually preconfigured with no or only insufficient security mechanisms. For example, if an employee includes an unapproved or unsecured access point on an internal network of the institution due to a lack of regulations, he or she undermines virtually all security measures taken in the LAN, such as: For example, the security gateway (firewall) protects against unauthorized external access.

### 2 4 Unsuitable selection of authentication methods

If authentication methods and mechanisms are missing or insufficient, security gaps can arise. For example, the IEEE 802.1X (Port Based Network Access Control) standard defines the EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol). Some of the described EAP methods contain vulnerabilities, eg. For example, EAP-MD5 is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle or dictionary attacks. If EAP-MD5 is used, passwords can be guessed and communication can be intercepted.

### 2 5 Incorrect configuration of the WLAN infrastructure

Access points and other WLAN components (eg WLAN controllers) offer a large number of configuration settings, which in particular also concern security functions. If wrong settings are made here, either no communication via an access point is possible or communication takes place unprotected or with too low a level of protection.

### 2 6 Insufficient or missing Wi-Fi security mechanisms

In the delivery state, WLAN components are often configured so that no or only a few security mechanisms are activated. Moreover, some of the mechanisms are inadequate and do not provide adequate protection. Even today, various WLAN components are used, the only insufficient security mechanisms such. B. WEP support. In part, these devices can not even be upgraded to stronger security mechanisms. If such devices are used, an attacker can easily listen to all communications and gain access to confidential information.

### 2 7 Listening to the WLAN communication

Since radio is a medium that several users can share ("shared medium"), the data transmitted via WLANs can be easily monitored and recorded. If the data is not or insufficiently encrypted, transmitted payload data can be easily obtained. In addition, radio networks or the radio waves transmitted often exceed the limits of the self-occupied premises, so that data are also broadcast in areas that can not be controlled and secured by the users or an institution.

### 2 8 Imitation of a valid access point (rogue access point)
An attacker can pretend to be part of the WLAN infrastructure by installing their own access point with a properly chosen SSID near a client. This fake access point is called a rogue access point. If this provides the WLAN client with a higher transmission power than the real access point, the client will use it as the base station if two-sided authentication is not enforced. In addition, the real access point could be turned off by a denial of service attack. Users log on to a network that only pretends to be the destination network. This makes it possible for an attacker to listen to the communication. Poisoning or spoofing methods also allow an attacker to fake a false identity or to redirect network traffic to his systems. So he can eavesdrop and control the communication. Especially in public radio networks (so-called hotspots), a rogue access point is a popular means of attack.

### 2 9 Unprotected LAN access at the access point

If access points are visible and mounted without physical protection, an attacker can switch between the access points and the switch infrastructure to monitor all network traffic. Even if the communication with WPA2 is encrypted, this poses a threat because these methods only secure the air interface, but do not consider the Ethernet connection further.

### 2 10 hardware damage

Hardware damage can cause radio traffic to be disturbed. In the worst case, the WLAN can even fail completely. This applies in particular to WLAN devices that are installed outside protected areas (eg to cover open spaces). You are exposed to additional hazards, such as intentional damage by attackers or environmental damage caused by weather or lightning.

### 2 11 Theft of an access point

Are WLAN access points unsecured in transit ways attached, z. B. installed directly under the ceiling or in areas with heavy public traffic, they can be stolen. This makes it possible, for example, to read out a shared-secret key for authentication on the RADIUS server or the key used (for example, for WPA2 personnel). With this information can then be accessed unauthorized access to the WLAN.
