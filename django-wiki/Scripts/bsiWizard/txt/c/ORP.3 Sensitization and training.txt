### 1.1 Introduction

In order to successfully and efficiently realize information security within an institution, employees are a necessary and significant success factor. Therefore, all employees must be aware of their roles in information security management. They need to know the security objectives of the institution, understand the security measures, and be prepared to provide them with effective support. For this purpose, an awareness of security (awareness) as well as a safety culture have to be developed and shaped in the institution.

Employees must be made aware of relevant hazards and how they can affect their institution. The better the employees know the risk situation, the sooner the appropriate security measures will be accepted. Employees must have the necessary knowledge to properly understand and apply measures. In particular, they must be aware of what is expected of them in terms of information security and how they should respond in safety-critical situations.

### 1.2 Objective

This module describes how to build and maintain an effective information security awareness and training program. The aim of awareness-raising and information security training is to enhance employees' perceptions of safety-critical situations and their impact, as well as providing them with the necessary knowledge and skills for safety-conscious behavior.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module looks at information security awareness and training related to both the institution's environment and teleworking and mobile work. The relevant topics of information security must be regularly trained and sensitized according to the institutional requirements.

The module * ORP.3 Sensitization and Training * describes the procedural, technical, methodological and organizational requirements for the sensitization and training of information security. Other training topics are planned, designed and carried out by the Personnel Department or the Institution's Continuing Education Management Department.

In order to avoid redundancies and strengthen the efficiency of education and training in the institution, the information security officer should regularly not only with the human resources department, but also with other security-related areas (data protection, health and safety, fire protection, etc.). change.

Many of the other IT-Grundschutz modules describe concrete training content on the subjects considered. This module focuses on how to efficiently organize a well-planned, cyclical and organizational approach in the areas of awareness-raising and information security training.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance to awareness raising and training.

### 2 1 Insufficient knowledge of regulations

Just setting information security regulations does not guarantee that they will be respected. All employees must also be aware of the applicable regulations, in particular the officials. In many security incidents, ignoring regulations is not the sole cause of the incident, but a reason for its effectiveness. Vulnerabilities due to insufficient knowledge of regulations may compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the information being processed. The fulfillment of tasks and the processing of business processes can be limited in every respect (eg temporal, qualitative, with regard to liability).
### 2 2 Insufficient awareness of information security

Experience shows that it is not enough just to order the implementation of certain security measures. Without an understanding of the reasons for the actions and their purpose, the measures often fail or are ignored. If employees become insufficiently sensitized to information security issues, operational and implementation-related risks arise in the technical and organizational business processes. The security culture, security objectives and security strategy of the institution may be jeopardized if employees are unable to relate directly to their real world of work, unless they are taught the purpose of security measures. This leads to a lack of acceptance of security measures and deficiencies in compliance.

### 2 3 Little successful awareness-raising and training activities

It is not always the activities carried out for awareness and training that are as successful as desired. Causes can be:

* lack of management support
* unclear goals
* bad planning
* lack of success control
* lack of continuity
* too little financial or human resources
In the absence of appropriate action to ensure the success of the activities undertaken, the goal of the respective training activity can often not be achieved. If the institution performs insufficient awareness-raising and training activities, information security issues may be compromised, directly leading to work-related limitations.

### 2 4 Inadequate training of employees on safety functionalities

Employees often do not apply newly introduced security programs and functionalities because they do not know how to use them, and self-training is considered too time-consuming in their day-to-day operations. In addition, lack of training after introducing new software can result in unintentional misoperation or configuration. Therefore, the procurement and installation of a (security) software is not enough. Unless trained enough about software or security functions, employees are unable to work properly with the institution's IT systems and applications. This can lead to errors in the operation and delay work processes unnecessarily. Precisely with critical IT systems and applications, a misuse can threaten the existence of the company.

### 2 5 Unrecognized security incidents

The daily operation of IT and ICS components can cause many failures and errors. There is a risk that security incidents will not be identified as such by the personnel and that cyber attacks or attempts to attack will go undetected. Security incidents and technical errors are sometimes not easy to distinguish. If users and administrators are not purposefully trained and sensitized to detecting and responding to security incidents, vulnerabilities can go undetected and exploited. If security incidents are not detected in time or not at all, appropriate and full countermeasures can not be taken in time. Small security loopholes in the institution can be exacerbated and become critical threats to integrity, confidentiality and availability. This can hinder business processes, cause financial damage or lead to regulatory and legal sanctions.

### 2 6 Non-compliance with safety measures
For a variety of reasons, such as carelessness or rush, it can happen that so confidential documents at workplaces lying open, escape doors can be opened by either side or emails are not encrypted. This can cause damage that would otherwise be prevented or at least reduced.

### 2 7 Carelessness in handling information

Often it can be observed that while institutions have a large number of organizational and technical security procedures, they are again undermined by the careless handling of specifications and technology. A typical example of this are the almost proverbial notes on the monitor, on which access passwords are noted. Likewise, a hard drive encryption on the laptop does not protect the confidential information from the seat neighbor in the train can be easily read. The best technical security solutions do not help when printouts with confidential information are left on the printer or end up in open-access waste paper containers.

When employees carelessly deal with information, established information security processes become ineffective. Unauthorized persons could, for. B. Use negligence in dealing with information in order to deliberately pursue economic espionage.

### 2 8 Poor acceptance of information security

Various circumstances may mean that information security requirements and requirements are not accepted in an institution or in parts of an institution and that there is therefore no insight into the need to implement security measures. This can, for example, be conditioned by the culture of the institution (motto: "That has always been so with us!") Or lack of exemplary function by the management. But even inappropriate or exaggerated security requirements can cause employees to reject security measures. Likewise, a different social or cultural background ("other countries, other customs") could lead to security measures not being implemented. Problems could also arise from the fact that certain user rights or the equipment with certain hardware or software are seen as a status symbol. Restrictions in these areas can meet with great resistance.

### 2 9 Social Engineering

Social engineering is a way to gain unauthorized access to information or IT systems by "listening" to employees. In social engineering, an attacker usually builds up a direct contact with a victim, eg. B. by phone, e-mail or via social networks. Social engineering attacks are often multi-level. By simulating insider knowledge and at the same time appealing to helpfulness, the attacker can expand his knowledge in further steps. If employees are not adequately sensitized to this type of attack, there is a danger that they will be manipulated through skilful communication to act inappropriately. As a result, they may leak internal information, catch malware, or even transfer money to alleged business partners.

In the "boss trick" - the English term is CEO Fraud - is a fictitious order of the boss is fooled by clerks who are allowed to transfer money on behalf of the company. They are to carry out transactions for an allegedly urgent and secretive business, which are extremely important for the further existence of the enterprise. In the course of 2016, fraudsters managed to cause damage in the range of six to eight figures to thousands of companies in thousands of companies. The damage worldwide is in the billions.

3 requirements
---------------
Specific requirements for * Sensitization and Training * are listed below. Basically, the information security officer is responsible for meeting the requirements. Deviations from this are mentioned separately in the corresponding requirements. The Information Security Officer (ISB) should always be involved in strategic decisions. In addition, the ISB is responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy.

### 3.1 Basic requirements

The following requirements MUST be implemented as a priority:

#### ORP.3.A1 Sensitization of Information Security Management [Supervisors, Institutional Management]

Institutional leadership MUST strongly and actively support safety campaigns and training for employees. Therefore, the support of management MUST be obtained before the start of an information security awareness and training program. The management MUST be sufficiently sensitized to safety issues.

All supervisors MUST support information security by setting a good example. Managers MUST enforce safety standards and alert their employees to compliance.

#### ORP.3.A2 Contact for security questions

In each institution there must be contact persons for security questions who can answer seemingly simple as well as complex or technical questions. The contact persons MUST be known to all employees of the institution. Such information MUST be readily available and available in the institution for everyone.

#### ORP.3.A3 Instruction of the staff in the safe handling of IT [Supervisors, Human Resources, IT Operations]

All employees and external users MUST be instructed and sensitized in the safe handling of IT, ICS and IoT components, as far as this is relevant to their work contexts. Binding, understandable, up-to-date and available guidelines for the use of the respective components MUST be available. If IT, ICS or IoT systems or services are used in ways that conflict with the interests of the institution, this MUST be communicated.

### 3.2 Standard requirements

Together with the basic requirements, the following requirements are in line with the state of the art in the area of ​​awareness and training. They SHOULD be implemented in principle.

#### ORP.3.A4 Designing an information security awareness and training program

In order to sensitize the employees, a target group-oriented sensitization and training program SHOULD be created. It SHOULD be regularly reviewed and updated.

#### ORP.3.A5 Analysis of target groups for awareness-raising and training programs

Awareness and training programs SHOULD be geared to the respective target groups. For this, a target group analysis SHOULD be carried out so that measures can be focused on special requirements and different backgrounds.

#### ORP.3.A6 Planning and Conducting Information Security Education and Training
All employees SHOULD be trained according to their responsibilities and responsibilities for information security issues. It SHOULD therefore provide awareness-raising and training activities that provide employees with all the information and skills necessary to implement safety regulations and policies in place within the institution. For this reason, the awareness and training content SHOULD be structured and planned according to the target groups, tasks and responsibilities of the employees. The planned awareness-raising and training measures SHOULD be implemented in an appropriate manner according to this plan. Awareness and training programs SHOULD be regularly reviewed for up-to-dateness and adapted or further developed as the need arises.

#### ORP.3.A7 Training on how to proceed according to IT-Grundschutz

Security officers SHOULD be familiar with the IT-Grundschutz methodology. Once a training need has been verified, a corresponding IT-Grundschutz training course should be planned and its content predefined. Within the training the procedure SHOULD be practiced on the basis of practical examples.

#### ORP.3.A8 Measurement and Evaluation of Learning Success [Human Resources]

The information security learning outcomes SHOULD be measured and evaluated by target group to determine the extent to which the goals outlined in the awareness-raising and training programs have been achieved. The measurements SHOULD consider both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the awareness-raising and training programs. The results SHOULD be used to improve the awareness-raising and training offer.

### 3.3 Requirements for increased protection requirements

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that go beyond the level of protection afforded by the state of the art and should BE considered AT INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ORP.3.A9 Specialized Training of Exposed Persons and Institutions (CIA)

Particularly exposed persons such as officials as well as employees in particularly exposed institutions or organizational areas SHOULD receive in-depth training with regard to possible hazards as well as appropriate behaviors and precautionary measures.
