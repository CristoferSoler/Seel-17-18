### 1.1 Introduction

In order to successfully and efficiently realize information security within an institution, employees are a necessary and significant success factor. Therefore, all employees must be aware of their roles in information security management. They need to know the security objectives of the institution, understand the security measures, and be prepared to provide them with effective support. For this purpose, an awareness of security (awareness) as well as a safety culture have to be developed and shaped in the institution.

Employees must be made aware of relevant hazards and how they can affect their institution. The better the employees know the risk situation, the sooner the appropriate security measures will be accepted. Employees must have the necessary knowledge to properly understand and apply measures. In particular, they must be aware of what is expected of them in terms of information security and how they should respond in safety-critical situations.

### 1.2 Objective

This module describes how to build and maintain an effective information security awareness and training program. The aim of awareness-raising and information security training is to enhance employees' perceptions of safety-critical situations and their impact, as well as providing them with the necessary knowledge and skills for safety-conscious behavior.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module looks at information security awareness and training related to both the institution's environment and teleworking and mobile work. The relevant topics of information security must be regularly trained and sensitized according to the institutional requirements.

The module * ORP.3 Sensitization and Training * describes the procedural, technical, methodological and organizational requirements for the sensitization and training of information security. Other training topics are planned, designed and carried out by the Personnel Department or the Institution's Continuing Education Management Department.

In order to avoid redundancies and strengthen the efficiency of education and training in the institution, the information security officer should regularly not only with the human resources department, but also with other security-related areas (data protection, health and safety, fire protection, etc.). change.

Many of the other IT-Grundschutz modules describe concrete training content on the subjects considered. This module focuses on how to efficiently organize a well-planned, cyclical and organizational approach in the areas of awareness-raising and information security training.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance to awareness raising and training.

### 2 1 Insufficient knowledge of regulations

Just setting information security regulations does not guarantee that they will be respected. All employees must also be aware of the applicable regulations, in particular the officials. In many security incidents, failure to comply with regulations is not the sole cause of the incident, but a reason for its effectiveness. Vulnerabilities due to insufficient knowledge of regulations may compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the information being processed. The fulfillment of tasks and the processing of business processes can be limited in every respect (eg temporal, qualitative, with regard to liability).
### 2 2 Insufficient awareness of information security

Experience shows that it is not enough just to order the implementation of certain security measures. Without an understanding of the reasons for the measures and the purpose they serve, the measures often fail or are ignored. If employees become insufficiently sensitized to information security issues, operational and implementation-related risks arise in the technical and organizational business processes. The security culture, security objectives and security strategy of the institution may be jeopardized if employees are unable to relate directly to their real world of work, unless they are taught the purpose of security measures. This leads to a lack of acceptance of security measures and deficiencies in compliance.

### 2 3 Little successful awareness-raising and training activities

It is not always the activities carried out to raise awareness and training that are as successful as desired. Causes can be:

* lack of management support
* unclear goals
* bad planning
* lack of success control
* lack of continuity
* too little financial or human resources
In the absence of appropriate action to ensure the success of the activities undertaken, the goal of the respective training activity can often not be achieved. If the institution performs insufficient awareness-raising and training activities, information security issues may be compromised, directly leading to work-related limitations.

### 2 4 Inadequate training of employees on safety functionalities

Employees often do not apply newly introduced security programs and functionalities because they do not know how to use them, and self-training is considered too time-consuming in their day-to-day operations. In addition, lack of training after introducing new software can result in unintentional misoperation or configuration. Therefore, the procurement and installation of a (security) software is not enough. Unless trained enough about software or security functions, employees are unable to work properly with the institution's IT systems and applications. This can lead to errors in the operation and delay work processes unnecessarily. Precisely with critical IT systems and applications, a misuse can have a life-threatening impact.

### 2 5 Unrecognized security incidents

The daily operation of IT and ICS components can cause many failures and errors. There is a risk that security incidents will not be identified as such by the personnel and that cyber attacks or attempts to attack will go undetected. Security incidents and technical errors are sometimes not easy to distinguish. If users and administrators are not purposefully trained and sensitized to detecting and responding to security incidents, vulnerabilities can go undetected and exploited. If security incidents are not detected in time or not at all, appropriate and full countermeasures can not be taken in time. Small security loopholes in the institution can be exacerbated and become critical threats to integrity, confidentiality and availability. This can hinder business processes, cause financial damage or lead to regulatory and legal sanctions.

### 2 6 Non-compliance with safety measures
For a variety of reasons, such as carelessness or rush, it can happen that so confidential documents at workplaces lying open, escape doors can be opened by either side or emails are not encrypted. This can cause damage that would otherwise be prevented or at least reduced.

### 2 7 Carelessness in handling information

Often it can be observed that while institutions have a large number of organizational and technical security procedures, they are again undermined by the careless handling of specifications and technology. A typical example of this are the almost proverbial notes on the monitor, on which access passwords are noted. Likewise, a hard drive encryption on the laptop does not protect the confidential information from the seat neighbor in the train can be easily read. The best technical security solutions do not help when printouts with confidential information are left on the printer or end up in open-access waste paper containers.

When employees carelessly deal with information, established information security processes become ineffective. Unauthorized persons could, for. B. Use negligence in dealing with information in order to deliberately pursue economic espionage.

### 2 8 Poor acceptance of information security

Various circumstances may mean that information security requirements and requirements are not accepted in an institution or in parts of an institution, and thus there is no insight into the need to implement security measures. This can, for example, be conditioned by the culture of the institution (motto: "That has always been so with us!") Or lack of exemplary function by the management. But even inappropriate or exaggerated security requirements can cause employees to reject security measures. Likewise, a different social environment or cultural background ("other countries, other customs") could lead to security measures not being implemented. Problems could also arise from the fact that certain user rights or the equipment with certain hardware or software are seen as a status symbol. Restrictions in these areas can meet with great resistance.

### 2 9 Social Engineering

Social engineering is a way to gain unauthorized access to information or IT systems by "listening" to employees. In social engineering, an attacker usually builds up a direct contact with a victim, eg. B. by phone, e-mail or via social networks. Social engineering attacks are often multi-level. By simulating insider knowledge and at the same time appealing to helpfulness, the attacker can expand his knowledge in further steps. If employees are not adequately sensitized to this type of attack, there is a danger that they will be manipulated by skilful communication to act improperly. As a result, they may leak internal information, catch malware, or even transfer money to alleged business partners.

In the "boss trick" - the English term is CEO Fraud - is a fictitious order of the boss is fooled by clerks who are allowed to transfer money on behalf of the company. They are to carry out transactions for an allegedly urgent and secretive business, which are extremely important for the further existence of the enterprise. In the course of 2016, fraudsters managed to cause damage in the range of six to eight figures to thousands of companies in thousands of companies. The damage worldwide is in the billions.
