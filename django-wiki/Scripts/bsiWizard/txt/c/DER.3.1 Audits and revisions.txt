### 1.1 Introduction

Audits and revisions are fundamental to any successful information security management system (ISMS). Only when established security measures and processes are regularly reviewed, are they effective, complete, appropriate and up-to-date can the overall state of information security be assessed. Audits and audits are thus a tool to identify, achieve and maintain an appropriate level of safety. Through them, it is possible to detect undesirable developments and existing security deficiencies and initiate appropriate countermeasures.

Auditing is a systematic, independent review of activities and their results in terms of compliance with defined requirements (eg standards, standards or guidelines). In a revision (audit = check, check) it is checked whether documents, conditions, objects or procedures are correct, effective and appropriate. In contrast to the audit, the revision does not necessarily have to be independent. In addition, the revision may already include the correction in terms of maintenance.

### 1.2 Objective

The module defines requirements for audits and audits with the aim of improving information security in an institution, avoiding undesirable developments in this area and optimizing security measures and processes.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module describes how audits and revisions can be planned, carried out and followed up from the point of view of the ISMS. This concerns internal audits (so-called first-party audits) and audits as well as audits of service providers and partners (so-called second-party audits) of the institution. Certification audits (so-called third-party audits) are not included in this module.

Similarly, the mandatory for Federal authorities IS audit is not considered. This is dealt with in module DER 3.2: * IS-Revision *. Furthermore, it does not take into account how audits and revisions can be integrated into any existing, higher-level test organization of an institution.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in audit and audit:

### 2 1 Inadequate or unscheduled implementation of security measures

The level of protection of an institution depends on complete and correct implementation of security measures. In particular, in the critical phase of projects or under certain circumstances, it may happen that security measures are temporarily suspended. However, some people forget to reactivate them, resulting in too low a level of security.

### 2 2 Ineffective or non-economic implementation of security measures

If security measures are implemented without taking into account certain practical aspects, the measures may be ineffective. For example, it is meaningless to lock the entrance area with turnstiles if the staff can easily enter the building through an open side entrance.

Likewise, individual measures can be taken that do not make economic sense. Thus, for the protection of information with a normal confidentiality, a cleanly implemented rights and role concept is more useful and economical than a certificate authority and the subsequent certificate-based encryption of the file server.

### 2 3 Insufficient implementation of the ISMS
In many institutions, the information security officer himself checks whether security measures have been implemented. Often it will forget about checking the actual ISMS. Especially as this should be done by an independent third party. This could render the processes of an ISMS inefficient or inadequate. As a result, the security level of the institution may be affected.

### 2 4 Inadequate qualification of the examiner

If an auditor or an auditor is not sufficiently qualified or prepares insufficiently for the audits, he may incorrectly assess the security status of an institution during the audit or revision. As a result, he does not initiate the necessary or even the wrong corrective measures in his test report. In the worst case, this results in too high and thus not economic or too low and thus very risky securing of information.

### 2 5 Lack of long-term planning

If audits and revisions are not planned on a long-term and centralized basis, it can happen that individual areas are frequently audited and others are not audited at all. As a result, it is very difficult or even impossible to assess the security status of the information network.

### 2 6 Lack of planning and coordination when conducting an audit

If an audit is poorly scheduled and has not been agreed with all of the institution's employees concerned, it may not have the required or the wrong contacts available during the on-site audit. As a result, individual areas may not be audited at all. Even though the auditor has set appointments too narrowly for the individual areas, the planned investigation could only be superficial if there is not enough time available.

### 2 7 Lack of coordination with the Staff Committee

Audits and revisions can also be used to examine aspects that can be used to draw conclusions about the performance of employees. Thus, these exams could be considered performance appraisals. Failure to involve staff representatives may result in violations of the applicable codetermination law.

### 2 8 Intentional concealment of deviations

Employees may fear that the audit uncovers errors and seeks to conceal security issues. This could give a false picture of the actual status quo.
