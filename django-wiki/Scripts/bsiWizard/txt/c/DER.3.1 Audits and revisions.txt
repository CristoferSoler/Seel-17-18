### 1.1 Introduction

Audits and revisions are fundamental to any successful information security management system (ISMS). Only when established security measures and processes are regularly reviewed, are they effective, complete, adequate and up-to-date can the overall state of information security be assessed. Audits and audits are thus a tool to identify, achieve and maintain an appropriate level of safety. Through them, it is possible to detect undesirable developments and existing security deficiencies and initiate appropriate countermeasures.

Auditing is a systematic, independent review of activities and their results in terms of compliance with defined requirements (eg standards, standards or guidelines). In a revision (audit = check, check) it is checked whether documents, conditions, objects or procedures are correct, effective and appropriate. In contrast to the audit, the revision does not necessarily have to be independent. In addition, the revision may already include the correction in terms of maintenance.

### 1.2 Objective

The module defines requirements for audits and audits with the aim of improving information security in an institution, avoiding undesirable developments in this area and optimizing security measures and processes.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module describes how audits and revisions can be planned, carried out and followed up from the point of view of the ISMS. This concerns internal audits (so-called first-party audits) and audits as well as audits of service providers and partners (so-called second-party audits) of the institution. Certification audits (so-called third-party audits) are not included in this module.

Similarly, the mandatory for Federal authorities IS audit is not considered. This is dealt with in module DER 3.2: * IS-Revision *. Furthermore, it does not take into account how audits and revisions can be integrated into any existing, higher-level test organization of an institution.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in audit and audit:

### 2 1 Inadequate or unscheduled implementation of security measures

The level of protection of an institution depends on complete and correct implementation of security measures. In particular, in the critical phase of projects or under certain circumstances, it may happen that security measures are temporarily suspended. However, it is sometimes forgotten to reactivate them, resulting in too low a level of security.

### 2 2 Ineffective or non-economic implementation of security measures

If security measures are implemented without taking into account certain practical aspects, the measures may be ineffective. For example, it is meaningless to lock the entrance area with turnstiles if the staff can easily enter the building through an open side entrance.

Likewise, individual measures can be taken that do not make economic sense. Thus, for the protection of information with a normal confidentiality, a cleanly implemented rights and role concept is more useful and economical than a certificate authority and the subsequent certificate-based encryption of the file server.

### 2 3 Insufficient implementation of the ISMS
In many institutions, the information security officer himself checks whether security measures have been implemented. Often it will forget about checking the actual ISMS. Especially as this should be done by an independent third party. This could render the processes of an ISMS inefficient or inadequate. As a result, the security level of the institution may be affected.

### 2 4 Inadequate qualification of the examiner

If an auditor or an auditor is not sufficiently qualified or prepares insufficiently for the audits, he may incorrectly assess the security status of an institution during the audit or revision. As a result, he does not initiate the necessary or even the wrong corrective measures in his test report. In the worst case, this results in too high and thus not economic or too low and thus very risky securing of information.

### 2 5 Lack of long-term planning

If audits and revisions are not planned on a long-term and centralized basis, it can happen that individual areas are frequently audited and others are not audited at all. As a result, it is very difficult or even impossible to assess the security status of the information network.

### 2 6 Lack of planning and coordination when conducting an audit

If an audit is poorly scheduled and not reconciled with all affected employees of the institution, the required or the wrong contacts may not be available during the on-site inspection. As a result, individual areas may not be audited at all. Even though the auditor has set appointments too narrowly for the individual areas, the planned investigation could only be superficial if there is not enough time available.

### 2 7 Lack of coordination with the Staff Committee

Audits and revisions can also be used to examine aspects that can be used to draw conclusions about the performance of employees. Thus, these exams could be considered performance appraisals. Failure to involve staff representatives may result in violations of the applicable codetermination law.

### 2 8 Intentional concealment of deviations

Employees may fear that the audit uncovers errors and seeks to conceal security issues. This could give a false picture of the actual status quo.

3 requirements
---------------

The following are specific requirements for audit and audit. Basically, the Information Security Officer (ISB) is responsible for meeting the requirements. In addition, the ISB is responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met and verified in accordance with the established security policy.

### 3.1 Basic requirements

The following requirements MUST be implemented as a priority:

#### DER.3.1.A1 Definition of Responsibilities [Institutional Management]

The institution's management MUST designate an employee who is responsible for planning and initiating audits or revisions. It MUST be taken to ensure that no conflicts of interest arise, for. For example, if the own department is to be checked. The person responsible MUST monitor that the results of the audits and revisions are processed.

#### DER.3.1.A2 Preparation for an audit or revision

Before an audit or revision, the subject matter and the audit objectives MUST be specified. Also, the relevant contact persons MUST be informed. Depending on the object of investigation, the staff representatives MUST be informed about the planned audit or the planned revision.

#### DER.3.1.A3 Conducting an audit

During an audit it MUST be checked whether the requirements from guidelines, standards, etc. are met. The requirements MUST be known by the audited institution.
An audit MUST include a document review and an on-site audit. The on-site audit MUST ensure that the auditors never intervene actively in IT systems and do not give any instructions for changes to the subject matter.

All results of an audit MUST be documented in writing and summarized in an audit report. The audit report MUST be sent to the contact person of the institution in a timely manner.

#### DER.3.1.A4 Performing a revision

In the case of a revision, it MUST be checked whether the requirements are complete, correct, appropriate and up-to-date. Detected deviations MUST be corrected immediately if possible. The respective revisions MUST be documented with a change tracking.

#### DER.3.1.A5 Integration into the information security process

A guideline for internal ISMS auditing and a guideline for steering corrective measures SHOULD be prepared. The guidelines SHOULD specify that regular audits and revisions are part of and initiated by the security process.

In addition, it should be ensured that the results of the audits and revisions flow back into the ISMS and contribute to its improvement. Furthermore, the audits and revisions carried out, the results as well as the activities for the elimination of deficiencies and quality improvement SHOULD be included in the regular report of the information security officer to the management of the institution.

#### DER.3.1.A6 Definition of the basis for the audit and a single evaluation scheme

A uniform audit basis for audits SHOULD be established. For the assessment of the implementation of requirements, a uniform evaluation scheme SHOULD be defined and documented.

#### DER.3.1.A7 Creation of an audit program

A multi-year audit program SHOULD be established covering all audits and revisions to be performed. For the audit program, goals SHOULD be defined that derive in particular from the institutional goals as well as the information security goals.

For unforeseen events, reserves SHOULD be provided for in annual resource planning. The audit program SHOULD be subject to its own continuous improvement process.

#### DER.3.1.A8 Creation of a revision list

One or more revision lists SHOULD be maintained to document the current status of the revision objects and the planned revisions.

#### DER.3.1.A9 Selection of an appropriate audit or defense team

It should be a suitable team for each audit or for each revision. It SHOULD appoint a senior auditor (audit team leader) or lead auditor who has overall responsibility for carrying out the audits or revisions.

The size of the audit / audit team SHOULD be the same as the audit area. In particular, the competence requirements of the test subjects as well as the size and local distribution of the test area SHOULD be taken into account. The members of the audit / audit team SHOULD be adequately qualified.

The neutrality of the audit team SHOULD be ensured. In addition, the auditors should also be independent. If external service providers are used as auditors or auditors, they SHOULD check their independence and commit them to secrecy.

#### DER.3.1.A10 Creation of an audit or audit plan [audit team leader]
Before an audit or major audit, the audit team leader or lead auditor SHOULD create an audit or revision plan. For audits, the audit plan SHOULD be part of the final audit report. The audit plan SHOULD be updated throughout the audit and adjusted as needed. Minor revisions SHOULD be planned using the revision list.

Sufficient resources should be allocated to the audit / audit team.

#### DER.3.1.A11 Communication and Behavior during Exams [Auditing Team Leader]

Clear rules should be set for how the audit / audit team and the staff of the institution or department to be audited may share information. Thus, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that the information exchanged during an audit remains confidential and integrity.

Persons accompanying the audit SHOULD NOT influence the exams. In addition, they SHOULD be obliged to confidentiality.

#### DER.3.1.A12 Conducting a kick-off meeting [Auditing team leader]

There should be an initial interview between the audit team or audit team and the relevant contacts. The audit or revision procedure SHOULD be explained and the framework conditions of the on-site inspection agreed and confirmed by the respective responsible persons.

#### DER.3.1.A13 Inspection and verification of documents [audit team]

The document review in the course of audits SHOULD be done on the basis of the requirements specified in the test plan. All relevant documents SHOULD then be checked to see if they are up-to-date, complete and traceable. The results of the document review SHOULD be documented. They SHOULD include in the on-site exam, if that makes sense.

#### DER.3.1.A14 Selection of samples [audit team]

The audit team SHOULD select the samples for the on-site audit in a risk-oriented manner and justify and document them in a comprehensible manner. If the audit is performed on the basis of building block targets and measures, they SHOULD be selected using a predefined procedure. When selecting samples, the results of previous audits SHOULD also be taken into account.

#### DER.3.1.A15 Selection of suitable test methods [audit team]

The audit team SHOULD use appropriate methods for each of the issues under review, such as: Eg interviews (see DER.3.1.A8 * Conducting Interviews *) or Document Checks. In addition, care should be taken that all exams are proportionate.

#### DER.3.1.A16 On-site inspection schedule [audit team]

Together with the contact persons, the audit team SHOULD develop the schedule for the on-site inspection. The results SHOULD be documented in the audit plan.

#### DER.3.1.A17 Conducting the on-site inspection [audit team]

At the beginning of the on-site inspection, the audit team SHOULD have an in-depth interview with the people in charge of the institution concerned. Thereafter, all requirements specified in the test plan SHOULD be checked using the intended test methods. If a selected sample deviates from the documented status, the sample SHOULD be extended as needed until the situation is clarified. After the audit, the audit team SHOULD conduct a final meeting, briefly presenting the results without assessment and how to proceed. The conversation SHOULD be logged.

#### DER.3.1.A18 conducting interviews [audit team]

Interviews SHOULD be structured. Questions SHOULD be concise, precise and easy to understand. In addition, suitable questioning techniques SHOULD be used.

#### DER.3.1.A19 Review of the risk treatment plan [audit team]
The audit team SHOULD verify that the remaining residual risks to the information network are reasonable and sustainable. He SHOULD also check whether they are bindingly borne by the management. Measures that fundamentally contribute to the information security of the entire institution MUST NOT be included in the risk assumption.

The auditor SHOULD verify on a random basis whether or to what extent the measures specified in the risk treatment plan have been implemented.

#### DER.3.1.A20 Closing meeting [audit team]

The audit team SHOULD conduct a closing meeting with the respective persons in charge of the audited institution. In it, the preliminary audit results SHOULD be presented and the further activities presented.

#### DER.3.1.A21 Evaluation of tests [audit team]

After the on-site inspection, the information collected SHOULD be further consolidated and evaluated. After the eventually requested documentation and additional information have been evaluated, the audited measures SHOULD be definitively evaluated. To provide the requested documentation, a sufficient time window SHOULD be granted. Documents that have not been received by the agreed end date SHOULD be considered non-existent.

#### DER.3.1.A22 Creation of an audit report [audit team]

The audit team SHOULD transfer the results obtained to an audit report and document it comprehensibly. The results of the audit SHOULD be explained to those responsible in a presentation.

The audited institution SHOULD ensure that all relevant bodies receive, within a reasonable time, the passages of the audit report that are important and necessary to them.

The results of a revision SHOULD be documented uniformly.

#### DER.3.1.A24 Completion of the audit or audit [audit team]

After the audit or revision, all relevant documents, data media and IT systems SHOULD be returned or destroyed. This SHOULD be coordinated with the audited institution. Retention requirements from legal or other binding requirements SHOULD be considered accordingly. Further, the ISB SHOULD deactivate or delete any access approved for the audit or audit team.

It should be agreed with the auditors or auditors how to handle the results. It should also be stipulated that the audit results may not be forwarded to other institutions without the approval of the audited institution.

#### DER.3.1.A25 follow-up and initiation of follow-up

The deviations or defects identified in the audit report or in a revision SHOULD be remedied in a reasonable time. In order for the implementation status to be easily understood, the corrective measures to be implemented, including the time and responsibilities, SHOULD be documented. Also completed corrective measures SHOULD be documented. For this, an established method should already exist in the ISMS, which is to be used.

If there were serious deviations or defects, the audit / review team SHOULD verify that corrective action has been taken.

#### DER.3.1.A26 Monitor and customize the audit program

The audit program SHOULD be continuously monitored and adjusted to meet deadlines, audit objectives, audit content, and audit quality.

Using the existing audit program requirements and the results of the audits performed, SHOULD verify that the audit program is appropriate. Maybe it should be adapted.

#### DER.3.1.A27 Storage and archiving of documents for audits and revisions
Audit programs as well as documents for audits and audits SHOULD be filed and kept in a comprehensible and audit-proof manner in accordance with statutory or other regulatory requirements. It should be ensured that only authorized persons can access audit programs and documents (especially audit reports). After expiry of the archiving periods, the audit programs and documents SHOULD be destroyed safely.

### 3.3 Requirements for increased protection requirements

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that exceed the state of the art level of protection and should be considered IN THE EVENT OF INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### DER.3.1.A28 Security auditing of auditors (CI)

If auditors need access to sensitive information, they should be asked to provide evidence of their integrity and reputation. In the case of classified classified information, the members of the audit team SHOULD submit to a security clearance under the Security Review Act (SÜG). In this regard, the ISB SHOULD include the secret service officer or security officer of the institution.
