### 1.1 Introduction

A web server is the core component of every web offer: It accepts requests from the clients (browsers) and, if possible, returns the corresponding content. The data is usually transported via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its version encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS) HTTP Secure (HTTPS). Because web servers provide a simple interface between server applications and users, they are also commonly used for internal information and applications in institutional networks (intranets).

Web servers are (mostly) available directly on the Internet and thus offer an exposed attack surface. Therefore, they must be protected by appropriate protective measures.

### 1.2 Objective

The goal of the module is to protect the web server and the information provided by the web server.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The term web server is used for both the software that answers the HTTP requests and the IT systems that run this software. This module primarily looks at the web server software. Security aspects of the IT system on which the web server software is installed are handled in the corresponding building blocks of the IT systems layer (see SYS.1.1 * General Server * and, for example, SYS.1.3 * Server under Linux or * SYS.1.2. 2 * Windows Server 2012 *).

Recommendations on how to integrate web servers into the network architecture and secure them with firewalls can be found in the building blocks NET.1.1 * Network Architecture and Design * or NET.3.2 * Firewall *.

Dynamic content and HTML-beyond functions are provided by web applications or web services. These are not the subject of this module, but are covered in the modules APP.3.1 * Web Applications * and APP.3.5 * Web Services *.

The module CON.1 * Crypto Concept * describes how cryptographic keys can be managed securely.

-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the web server area:

### 2 1 Reputational loss

If attackers manage to manipulate or redesign a website (defacement), the reputation of the institution can be damaged. Similarly, the publication of false information (such as misleading product descriptions) may result in the reputation of the institution being lost to the public or the institution being warned. Damage can also occur if the website is unavailable and potential customers switch to competitors.

### 2 2 Manipulation of the web server

An attacker can gain access to a web server to manipulate files. For example, he could change the configuration, start additional services, install malware, or modify web content. He could also replace files that are offered for download by files with malicious programs. Also, an attacker may use the compromised server, for example, to perform DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. If your own server is used to distribute malicious software, it can happen that the web server is run on blacklists and is no longer accessible to visitors.

### 2 3 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

Due to DDoS attacks, a web server can partially or completely fail. For users, the web site is then only very slow or no longer available. For many institutions, such a failure is quickly critical to business, eg. B. for an online store.
In addition to DDoS, other types of denial-of-service attacks can affect the availability of a website specifically for individual users by, for example, blocking individual accounts from incorrect logins. An attacker could z. For example, a user account lock could be triggered by invalid login attempts.

### 2 4 Loss of confidential data

Many web servers still use outdated cryptographic techniques, such as RC4 or SSL. Inadequate authentication or inappropriate encryption can lead to attackers being able to read or change the communication between the clients and the servers or between the servers.

### 2 5 Violation of laws or regulations

Violations of legal regulations, in particular against telemedia and data protection laws, can have legal consequences. Further, the web server contents may violate copyright, such as when using images for which no rights have been acquired.

### 2 6 Software vulnerabilities or errors

If updates and patches for web servers or used extensions are not imported or received too late, the web server can be successfully attacked. This allows attackers to manipulate files or services or misuse the web server for further attacks.

### 2 7 Missing or poor troubleshooting

If errors occur during the operation of a web server, this can, for example, affect the availability of the web server. Also, content may be displayed incompletely or security mechanisms fail. If errors are not handled correctly, the operation and protection of the functions and data of a web server is no longer guaranteed.

### 2 8 Insufficient logging of security-relevant events

If security-relevant events are insufficiently logged by the web server, they can not be reconstructed at a later time and the cause can no longer be determined. Critical errors and attacks, such as unauthorized configuration changes, will go unnoticed for so long.
