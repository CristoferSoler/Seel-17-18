### 1.1 Introduction

Virtualization of IT systems involves running one or more virtual IT systems on a physical IT system. Such a physical IT system is called a virtualization server. Multiple virtualization servers can be grouped together to form a virtual infrastructure. In it, the virtualization servers themselves and the virtual IT systems running on them can be jointly managed.

The virtualization of IT systems offers many advantages for IT operation in an information network. Costs for hardware procurement, power and air conditioning can be saved by using the resources of the physical IT systems more efficiently. However, virtualization is also a challenge for the operation of the information network. Since the virtualization technology used touches on different areas and fields of work in the information network, knowledge and experience from a wide variety of areas must be brought together.

### 1.2 Objective

The module describes how virtualized IT systems in the information network can be safely introduced and operated.

### 1.3 Delimitation

In this module, only the virtualization of complete IT systems is discussed, other techniques, which are also partly associated with the word virtualization (application virtualization using terminal servers, storage virtualization, containers, etc.), are not the subject of this module.

In the field of software development, the terms * virtual machine * and * virtual machine monitor * are also used for runtime environments. Java, Microsoft .NET. Such runtime environments are also not considered in this building block.

Virtual infrastructures are typically managed with special management systems. Since these can be extensively accessed by the virtualization infrastructure, it is important to sufficiently secure them. This affects both the server (physical or virtual) on which the management software is running and the product itself. Details are described in the module NET.1.2 * Network Management *.

Virtualization environments are most commonly used with mass storage (NAS or SAN). Connection and protection of these systems are also not considered in this block (see block SYS.1.8 * Memory Solutions *).

Through virtualization, the networks of the institution must be structured differently. This topic is not covered comprehensively in this module. For this, the building block NET.1.1 * network architecture and design * must be implemented. Network virtualization is also touched on in this module. Security aspects of virtual network components are dealt with in the module NET.1.4 * Network Virtualization *.

In order to secure virtual IT systems, the respective components of the layer * SYS (IT systems) * must be used.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​virtualization:

### 2 1 Faulty virtualization planning

A virtualization server enables the operation of virtual IT systems, integrates the systems in the data center and controls their connection to other infrastructure elements, eg. B. networks and storage networks. Failure to plan how to integrate the virtualization servers technically and organizationally into the existing infrastructure can result in responsibilities for different areas not being clearly defined, e.g. For applications, operating systems and network components. Furthermore, the responsibilities of different areas may overlap, or there may be no appropriate rights structure to separate administrative accesses for the different areas.
### 2 2 Incorrect virtualization configuration

Virtualization changes the way servers are provisioned. Resources such as CPU, RAM, network connectivity, and storage are typically configured centrally through a management system and are no longer dictated by hardware and cabling. This can lead to faster configuration errors. If, for example, a highly vulnerable virtual IT system is incorrectly placed in an external DMZ, this can be accessed from the Internet and thus exposed to an increased risk.

### 2 3 Insufficient resources for virtual IT systems

Virtualization servers require storage for the operation of the virtual IT systems, either locally in the virtualization server itself or in a storage network. If the required storage capacities are not planned sufficiently large, there are far-reaching risks for the availability of the virtual IT systems and the integrity of the information processed in them. This is especially true when using special virtualization features such as snapshots or overbooking storage space.

Bottlenecks can not only affect the storage space on hard disks or in storage networks, but also the main memory (RAM) or the network connection. Also, with insufficient resources on the virtualization server, the virtual machines could interfere with each other's operations and eventually stop working or failing.

### 2 4 Information outflow or resource bottleneck through snapshots

A snapshot can be used to freeze and secure the state of a virtual machine. If such a snapshot is restored at a later time, any changes made in the meantime will be lost. As a result, already patched security vulnerabilities can be open again. In addition, open files, file transfers, or database transactions can result in inconsistent data at the time of the snapshot.

In addition, attackers can use snapshots to gain unauthorized access to the data of a virtual IT system. Because if the snapshot was taken on the fly, the contents of main memory are also backed up to disk and can be recovered and analyzed in a virtual environment outside of the original IT infrastructure. Likewise, snapshots can become very large and thus the storage capacity can be scarce.

### 2 5 Failure of the management server for virtualization systems

Since the management server controls and manages all the functions of a virtual infrastructure, a failure of this management system means that configuration changes to the virtual infrastructure can not be made. Administrators can not respond to issues such as resource bottlenecks or the failure of individual virtualization servers, integrate new virtualization servers into the infrastructure, or create new virtual IT systems. The * Live Migration * and thus the dynamic allocation of resources for individual guest systems is not possible without a management server.

### 2 6 Misuse of guest tools

Guest tools are often run with very high privileges. As a result, they can be misused for denial-of-service attacks, for example, or attackers take over the entire host system with them.

### 2 7 Compromising the virtualization software

The virtualization software (also: hypervisor) is the central component of a virtualization server, it controls all running virtual machines on this server and allocates them processor and memory resources. Successfully attacking this component also results in compromised server virtual IT systems.
