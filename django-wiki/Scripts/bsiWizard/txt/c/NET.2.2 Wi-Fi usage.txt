### 1.1 Introduction

Wireless LANs (WLANs) can be used to set up wireless local area networks or extend existing wired networks. To date, almost all WLAN components available on the market are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its additions. A special role is played by the manufacturer consortium Wi-Fi Alliance, which has created an industry standard based on the IEEE 802.11 standard with "Wi-Fi". The Wi-Fi Alliance confirms with the Wi-Fi seal of approval that a device has passed certain interoperability and conformance tests.

WLANs offer a gain in convenience and mobility, but the use of additional security potential for the security of the information, as it is wirelessly communicated. It is therefore essential that, in addition to the IT managers, the users are also sensitized to the potential dangers that can arise if WLANs are used improperly. This means that users must have the necessary knowledge to properly understand and apply security measures. In particular, they must be aware of what is expected of them in terms of information security and how they should respond in certain situations when using WLANs.

### 1.2 Objective

In this module will be shown how WLANs can be used safely.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module contains basic requirements that must be observed and fulfilled when using WLANs in order to be able to counteract the specific hazards. Requirements that can be used to operate WLANs safely, however, are not the subject of this module, but are described in the module NET.2.1 * WLAN operation *. In addition, the building block does not address general aspects of a client. Such aspects are discussed in the SYS2.1 * Common Client * building block.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​WLAN usage:

### 2 1 Insufficient knowledge of regulations

If users are not sufficiently familiar with the regulations for the correct handling of WLANs, they can not comply with it. If, for example, WLAN clients are thoughtlessly connected to foreign networks, the information transmitted via them (eg session cookies, passwords) can be intercepted.

### 2 2 Non-compliance with safety measures

Due to negligence and lack of controls, it happens again and again that people do not take into account the recommended or ordered security measures or not in full. If, for example, a WLAN client is used in ad hoc mode, although this is expressly forbidden in the user policy, another client can communicate directly with the WLAN client. B. unauthorized access to confidential documents stored on the client.

### 2 3 Listening to the WLAN communication

Since radio is a medium that several users can share ("shared medium"), the data transmitted via WLANs can be easily monitored and recorded. If the data is not or insufficiently encrypted, transmitted payload data can be easily obtained. In addition, radio networks or the radio waves transmitted often exceed the limits of the self-occupied premises, so that data are also broadcast in areas that can not be controlled and secured by the users or an institution.

### 2 4 Evaluation of connection data in wireless communication

For WLANs based on IEEE 802.11, the MAC address of a WLAN card is sent with every data transfer. Since it is transmitted unencrypted, motion profiles can be created via mobile users, eg. For example, when they log into public hotspots.
### 2 5 Imitation of a valid access point (rogue access point)

An attacker can pretend to be part of the WLAN infrastructure by installing their own access point with a properly chosen SSID near a client. This fake access point is called a rogue access point. If this provides the WLAN client with a higher transmission power than the real access point, the client will use it as the base station if two-sided authentication is not enforced. In addition, the real access point could be turned off by a denial of service attack. Users log on to a network that only pretends to be the destination network. This makes it possible for an attacker to listen to the communication. Poisoning or spoofing methods also allow an attacker to fake a false identity or to redirect network traffic to his systems. So he can eavesdrop and control the communication. Especially in public radio networks (so-called hotspots), a rogue access point is a popular means of attack.
