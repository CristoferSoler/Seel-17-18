### 1.1 Introduction

The staff of a company or authority forms the basis for its or its success or failure. At the same time, employees are an integral part of information security. Experience shows that even the most complex safety precautions without the correct behavior of the employees are ineffective. Awareness of what information security means to the institution and its business processes, and the proper treatment of employees with the information to be protected by the institution are therefore essential.

### 1.2 Objective

The purpose of this module is to identify what personal security measures are to be taken by the HR department or the supervisors of an institution so that employees can safely handle the institution's information and behave in accordance with the institution's security objectives and security requirements protective information. Starting with the hiring of employees until their departure, a variety of measures is required. In addition, of course, other groups of people who come into contact with the information of the institution should not be forgotten, such as employees of service providers and customers. Also for dealing with external, such. As visitors, cleaning personnel or maintenance technicians, appropriate security measures must be present.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module deals with the requirements that have to be observed and fulfilled by the HR department or the superiors of an institution. Personnel requirements that are tied to a specific function, such as For example, the appointment of the system administrator of a LAN, are listed in the modules that deal with the respective topic.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​human resources:

### 2 1 Staff shortage

The loss of personnel can mean that certain tasks can no longer or not be performed promptly.

### 2 2 Abuse of Permissions

Anyone who wants to edit information needs appropriate permissions. Users may misuse them by exploiting them to manipulate, transmit, or otherwise harm the institution.

### 2 3 Missing or inadequate regulations

If information security regulations are lacking, inadequate, unworkable or incomprehensible, this can lead to the necessary security measures not being implemented (see also G 0.29 Violation of laws or regulations).

### 2 4 Insufficient knowledge of regulations

The definition of regulations alone does not ensure their observance and trouble-free operation. All employees must also be aware of the applicable regulations, above all the officials. Damage that arises because existing regulations are not known, may not be excused with the statements: "I did not know that I am responsible." or "I did not know how to handle it."

### 2 5 Misconduct

Misbehavior of any type of person may interfere with the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information, business processes or IT systems. Depending on the need for protection of the information or the systems and depending on the authorizations of the polluters, the damages may be minor or critical.

### 2 6 Social Engineering

In social engineering, human characteristics such as Helpfulness, trust, fear or respect for authority are exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or IT systems through "listening out". This allows employees to be manipulated to act improperly.
### 2 7 Carelessness in handling information

Often it can be observed that while institutions have a large number of organizational and technical security procedures, they are again undermined by the careless handling of specifications and technology. A typical example of this are the almost proverbial notes on the monitor, on which access passwords are noted.

### 2 8 Unauthorized use of own IT systems

The unauthorized use of own IT systems by employees can generally be difficult to prevent. Using your own laptop, USB key, or smartphone within the IT landscape of an institution can lead to a variety of security risks, such as the inadvertent introduction of malicious programs.

### 2 9 Abuse of social networks

Social networks are very successful as platforms. However, in addition to the various advantages, there are also security risks that users should not lose sight of. So the data published on social networks can be used for the skillful password rate. In addition, social networks are particularly suitable for social engineering attacks, as here, on the one hand, a lot of background information can be collected and, on the other hand, the confidence assumed under "acquaintance" can be exploited.

### 2 10 Manipulation or destruction of equipment, information or software

Outside and inside perpetrators can try to manipulate or destroy devices, information or software for various reasons. The effects range from unauthorized access to sensitive data to the destruction of IT systems that can cause significant downtime.

3 requirements
---------------

The following are specific requirements for the personnel area. Basically, the HR department is responsible for fulfilling the requirements.

Listed below are exemplary proposals for requirements that go beyond the level of protection afforded by the state of the art and should BE considered AT INCREASED PROTECTION. The concrete determination takes place within the framework of a risk analysis. The letters in parentheses indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the requirement (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### ORP.2.A11 Safety Culture Analysis (CIA)
