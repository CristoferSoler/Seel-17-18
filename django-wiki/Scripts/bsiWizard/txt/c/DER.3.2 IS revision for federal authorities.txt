### 1.1 Introduction

The "Implementation Plan for the Guarantee of IT Security in the Federal Administration" (UP Bund) stipulates that federal authorities must fully implement IT-Grundschutz. They are also required to carry out a comprehensive information security audit (IS audit) at least every 3 years. However, authorities are exempted if they have an ISO 27001 IT-Grundschutz-based certificate.

IS revisions are essential to any successful information security management. Only when established security measures and processes are regularly reviewed, are they effective, complete, appropriate and up-to-date can the overall state of information security be assessed. IS revisions are thus a tool to identify, achieve, and maintain an appropriate level of security. Through them, it is possible to detect undesirable developments and existing security deficiencies and initiate appropriate countermeasures.

### 1.2 Objective

The module defines requirements for the IS audit for federal authorities with the aim of improving information security in an authority, avoiding undesirable developments in this area and optimizing security measures and processes.

### 1.3 Delimitation

The module describes how IS audits in federal agencies can be planned, carried out and followed up on the basis of the "* Information Security Audit Manual *". However, the module only compiles the obligations within the scope of the IS audit. The binding rules for the IS revision are the "* Guide for the Information Security Revision *" in the current version

Audits and revisions within the Information Security Management System (ISMS) are considered in the module DER.3.1 * Audit and Revision * and are therefore not part of this module. It also does not take into account how the IS audit can be integrated into an existing, higher-level audit organization of an authority (for example internal audit).

The module is aimed especially at federal authorities. In principle, however, the content may also be relevant to other authorities (eg state authorities), companies or other organizations. Unless these are also obliged by law, contract or other regulations to the IS audit, the contents of this module are to be regarded as recommendations. For example, an IS audit in the sense of this module could also be useful for institutions other than federal authorities for preparing ISO 27001 certification based on IT-Grundschutz.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the * IS audit for federal agencies *:

### 2 1 Violation of the requirements of the UP Bund

Among other things, the UP Bund envisages that all federal authorities that do not yet have full ISO 27001 certification based on IT-Grundschutz be subject to a regular IS audit. If federal authorities do not regularly carry out IS revisions, they violate these requirements.

### 2 2 Override security measures

The level of security of an authority depends on full and correct implementation of security measures. In particular, in the critical phase of projects or under certain circumstances, it may happen that security measures are temporarily suspended. However, some people forget to reactivate them, resulting in too low a level of security.

### 2 3 Ineffective or non-economic implementation of security measures
If security measures are implemented without taking into account certain practical aspects, the measures may be ineffective. For example, it is meaningless to lock the entrance area with turnstiles if the staff can easily enter the building through an open side entrance.

Likewise, individual measures can be taken that do not make economic sense. Thus, for the protection of information with a normal confidentiality, a cleanly implemented rights and role concept is more useful and economical than a certificate authority and the subsequent certificate-based encryption of the file server.

### 2 4 Insufficient implementation of the information security management system

In many agencies, the information security officer himself checks whether security measures have been implemented. Often it will forget about checking the actual ISMS. Especially as this should be done by an independent third party. As a result, there is a risk that the processes of an ISMS are inefficient or have not been adequately implemented. As a result, the security level of the institution is impaired.

### 2 5 Inadequate qualification of the examiner

If an IS auditor is not sufficiently qualified or prepares insufficiently for the audits, he may incorrectly assess the security status of an authority during the IS audit. As a result, he does not initiate the necessary or even the wrong corrective measures in his test report. In the worst case, this results in too high and thus not economic or too low and thus very risky securing of information.

### 2 6 Lack of long-term planning

If IS revisions are not planned on a long-term and centralized basis, it can happen that individual areas of one authority are checked very frequently and others not at all. As a result, it is very difficult or even impossible to assess the security status of the information network.

### 2 7 Lack of planning and coordination when performing IS revisions

If an IS audit is poorly scheduled and not voted on by all of the agency's affected staff, the required or wrong contacts may not be available during the on-site audit. As a result, individual areas may not be tested at all. Even though the IS auditor has set the appointments too narrowly for the individual areas, there is a risk that the planned examination will be carried out only superficially because too little time is available.

### 2 8 Lack of coordination with the Staff Committee

IS revisions can also be used to check aspects that can be used to draw conclusions about the performance of employees. Thus, these exams could be considered performance appraisals. Failure to involve staff representatives may result in violations of the applicable codetermination law.

### 2 9 Intentional concealment of deviations or problems

Employees may fear that an IS Revison will detect bugs and try to conceal security issues and misrepresent the true status quo.

### 2 10 Confidentiality loss of sensitive information

During an IS audit, various confidential information is collected by the auditors. Deficits in the information security of the audited authority are also named. However, if these deficiencies become known to unauthorized third parties, they could be used to attack the authority.
