### 1.1 Introduction

Malicious programs are programs that typically perform malicious functions on the IT system without the knowledge and consent of the user or owner of an IT system. These capabilities can cover a wide range, from espionage to ransomware, to the sabotage and destruction of information or even devices.

Malicious programs can generally occur on all operating systems and IT systems. In addition to classic IT systems such as clients and servers, these also include mobile devices such as smartphones. Network components such as routers, industrial control systems and even IoT devices, such as networked cameras, are also frequently endangered by malicious programs.

Malicious software spreads on classic IT systems mostly via e-mail attachments, manipulated websites (drive-by downloads) or data carriers. Smartphones are usually infected via the installation of malicious apps, even drive-by downloads are possible. In addition, open network interfaces, faulty configurations, and software vulnerabilities are common entry points on all IT systems.

In this module, the term "virus protection program" is used. "Viruses" are synonymous with all types of malware. What is meant is a program to protect against any kind of malware.

### 1.2 Objective

This module describes the procedure for creating and implementing protection against malicious programs in order to effectively protect an institution against malicious programs.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module describes the general requirements for protection against malicious programs. Specific requirements to protect certain IT systems of the institution against malicious programs can be found in the respective building blocks, in particular the layer SYS, for example in SYS.2.2.3 Client under Windows 10. If an identified malicious program leads to a security incident, the requirements of the Building block DER.2.1. Treatment of security incidents. The requirements of the DER.2.3 Cleanup block help to remove identified malicious programs and restore a clean state.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​malware protection:

### 2 1 Software vulnerabilities and drive-by downloads

If IT systems are not adequately protected against malicious programs, which also requires, among other things, that patches are brought in quickly and the protection mechanisms of application programs such as browsers are correctly configured, software vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute malicious code. In the so-called drive-by downloads, for example, it is sufficient to visit a malicious website. A vulnerability in the browser or in an installed plug-in such as Java or Adobe Flash can then be exploited to infect the IT system and provide the attacker with extensive control and access to the network of an institution. Particularly at risk here are IT systems that are not regularly updated, such as many smartphones.

### 2 2 Blackmail by ransomware

A common type of malware is ransomware. This encrypts the data of the infected IT system as well as often other data that can be reached via network shares. As a rule, the attackers use encryption methods that can not be reversed without knowing the key, thus forcing their victims to spend large sums of money. If there is no effective protection against malicious programs and no additional precautions like data backups are made, there can be significant restrictions on the availability of information as well as massive financial and image damage.

### 2 3 Targeted Attacks and Social Engineering
Institutions are often attacked with customized malicious programs. This z. B. Leading executives through social engineering methods to open malicious email attachments. Tailor-made malicious programs often can not be detected directly by virus protection programs. The human resources department of an institution, for example, can be a target, for example by malicious application documents are sent by electronic means. If the attacker has been able to infect an IT system in this way, he can spread within the institution and, for example, steal, manipulate or destroy information.

### 2 4 Mobile media infections

If the users are not adequately sensitized, mobile data carriers can also serve as a gateway for malicious programs. An attacker can z. B. malicious USB sticks on the grounds of an institution, which are then connected by inexperienced users to IT systems. If there is insufficient protection against malicious programs, an attacker can also gain access to the network and the data of the institution in this way.

### 2 5 botnets

Through malicious programs, IT systems of an institution can become part of so-called botnets. For example, an attacker who frequently controls thousands of systems in such a botnet can use them to send spam or launch distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks to third parties. Even if your own institution may not be directly harmed, it can still have a negative impact on the availability and integrity of your own services and IT systems, and may even cause legal problems.

### 2 6 Infection of production systems and IoT devices

In addition to classic IT systems, devices are increasingly being attacked by malicious programs, which at first glance do not seem like obvious targets. For example, an attacker could infect a surveillance camera accessible via the Internet to spy on them. But even a networked light bulb or an app-controlled coffee machine can serve as an entry point into the institution's network or as part of a botnet if those devices are not adequately protected from malicious programs. Networked production systems or industrial controls can also be maliciously manipulated or even destroyed, which can lead to downtime and many other threats to the institution and its employees, such as fires.
