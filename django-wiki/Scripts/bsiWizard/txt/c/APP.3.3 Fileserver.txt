### 1.1 Introduction

A file server (or file server) is a server in a network that centrally provides files for all authorized users or clients. The data can be used by authorized users at the same time, without this z. B. to removable media or to distribute by e-mail. By keeping the data central, the data can be structured and provided in different file versions. For file servers, rights can be assigned centrally and data backup can be done centrally.

A file server usually manages mass storage devices that are connected to it via interfaces such as SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) or SAS (Serial Attached SCSI). The memories are located either directly in the housing of the file server or are connected externally. The latter is often referred to as Directly Attached Storage (DAS). A file server can work on conventional server hardware or a dedicated appliance, such as a server. As a Network Attached Storage (NAS) operated. In the case of large volumes of data, central storage area networks (SANs) can often be connected via HBA (Host Bus Adapter) in the server and SAN switches.

### 1.2 Objective

This module describes the specific threats for a file server and the resulting requirements for safe operation.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module contains basic requirements that must be observed and fulfilled when operating file servers. General and operating system-specific aspects of a server are not the subject of the present module, but are dealt with in the SYS1.1 General Server module and in the corresponding operating system-specific components of the IT systems layer. For example, SYS.1.3 Unix Server or SYS.1.2.2 Windows Server 2012. Furthermore, no requirements for storage systems or storage networks are described; these can be found in the SYS.1.8 Storage Systems block. Also, it does not deal with dedicated services that can be used to run a file server, e.g. B. samba.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance to file servers:

### 2 1 Failure of a file server

If a file server fails, the entire information network can be affected and thus also important business processes of the institution. In addition to users, applications may rely on data from the file server to function properly. If the availability of data and services is not given, z. Deadlines are not met or essential business processes fail. If no emergency management concept has been implemented, recovery times can increase further. In many cases this will lead to financial losses of the institution or it will affect other institutions.

### 2 2 Inadequate dimensioning of the file server

If the line connection or storage capacity of the file server is insufficiently dimensioned, access times may increase or memory bottlenecks occur. For example, there is a risk that employees will be frustrated by the lengthy wait times and begin storing data locally. This means it is no longer possible to understand where data is stored and who owns the data.

### 2 3 Inadequate review of dropped files
If a file server is insufficiently included in the concept of protection against malicious programs of the institution, there is a risk that attackers unnoticed place malicious software on the file server. As a result, the data on the file server can be viewed unauthorized or manipulated. But there are also security risks for all devices and applications that access the file server's data. For example, malware can quickly spread throughout the institution.

### 2 4 Missing or insufficient access authorization concept

If access authorizations and releases are not properly designed and assigned, third parties may be able to access data without authorization. This allows attackers to modify, delete or copy data.

### 2 5 Unstructured data management

If the storage structure is not specified or the employees do not stick to it, data can be stored in a confusing and uncoordinated manner on the file server. This leads to various problems, such as space wastage due to redundancy, unauthorized access when z. For example, files may be located in directories or file systems that are made accessible to third parties or that are not consistent versions.

### 2 6 Unsuitable installation of the file server

If file servers are deployed in easily accessible locations, attackers can directly access their components and thus the stored data, eg. B. by removing drives or remove and take away. Smaller NAS systems can also be easily stolen completely. It is also possible that an attacker directly leverages the access restrictions on the file server and thus can view sensitive data. Once he has access, he can also import malicious programs and thus jeopardize the security of the entire network.

### 2 7 Lack of or insufficient data protection concept

If a file server fails completely, individual components are defective or an employee unintentionally deletes files, important data can be lost without a functioning backup. In addition, if no RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) are used, the failure of a single disk has a direct effect on the current operation, since the files are no longer available.
