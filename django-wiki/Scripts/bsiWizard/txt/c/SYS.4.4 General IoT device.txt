### 1.1 Introduction

In this module, devices with functions from the field of Internet of Things (IoT) are considered. In contrast to "classic" IT systems, these are "intelligent" objects that contain additional "smart" functions. IoT devices are typically connected to data networks, in many cases wirelessly, and can often access and be accessed over the Internet. This can have an impact on the information security of the entire information network.

IoT devices can be present in institutions because they are brought by employees or external, for. For example, smartwatches or wearables. In many institutions but also IoT devices are procured and operated, z. For example, devices such as fire, gas, and other alarms, coffee machines, or building control elements such as cameras and HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning).

In general, a distinction can be made between directly addressable IoT devices and IoT devices, which require a central control unit. Directly addressable devices are usually connected to a data network with their own IP address and can act autonomously or managed by a central control unit. But there are also IoT devices that only communicate directly with control units, eg. B. over wireless networks such as Bluetooth or ZigBee, and thus not directly connected to data networks. The range of these radio links can, if provided, be increased by a separate, meshed network, with each device establishing a radio link with each device.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of this module is to secure IoT devices so that neither the security of the information and IT of their own institution nor that of outsiders is impaired. Therefore, both unauthorized data leakage and manipulation of the devices should be prevented, especially with regard to attacks on third parties.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module is generally concerned with IoT devices and is intended to be applicable to a wide range of different IoT devices. Dedicated security features such as control and display systems or specific hardware and software architectures are not discussed in detail.

Depending on the nature of the IoT devices, the transitions to industrial control systems (ICS systems) or embedded systems are fluid. Requirements for equipment used in production and manufacturing can be found in the building blocks of the layer IND (Industrial IT).

Embedded systems are information processing systems that are integrated into a larger system or product, where they take over control, regulation and data processing tasks and are often not directly perceived by the user. For this block SYS.4.3 Embedded Systems has to be implemented.

Requirements for the radio links frequently used in the context are in the building blocks of the layer NET.2 radio networks.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in IoT devices:

### 2 1 Spying on IoT devices

In the development of IoT devices, the aspect of information security is typically a design goal that is not respected or only subordinate. Therefore, IoT devices could be abused again and again to gather information about the users or the field of application. So it has always come back to incidents with networked or IP-based surveillance cameras, z. B .:

* In 2013, several banks in different countries were compromised via surveillance cameras as part of the "Carbanak" campaign. The perpetrators captured a three-digit million amount. These attacks spied screen content and keystrokes in financial institutions through the cameras.
* In 2014, video images and streams from 73,000 inadequately-protected webcams were made publicly available through the Insecam website.
* In 2015, 8-year-old Malware Conficker infected a variety of bodycams from various police forces.
### 2 2 Using UPnP

LAN's built-in IoT devices often connect to the Internet on their own by configuring routers in the network using UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to provide port forwarding. The devices can then not only communicate in the local network, but are also not only visible from outside the LAN, but also accessible. If then a vulnerability in the IoT device is exploited by an attacker, this could become part of a botnet, but it could also be introduced more malicious software in the information network. This gap can theoretically be used for other activities at a later date.

### 2 3 Third Party Damage

If IoT devices are not regularly patched, known vulnerabilities remain open and can be exploited for large-scale attacks. One target of an attack could be to integrate the IoT devices into a botnet. In this case, they could be used, for example, to perform Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and to limit the availability of services.

Example: At the end of October 2016, a DDoS attack on an Internet service provider using a botnet consisting largely of IoT devices was used. Due to the large number of devices, the so-called Mirai botnet has reached a bandwidth that goes far beyond the previously known botnets. The webcams, cameras, DVR players, routers and printers that already belonged to the botnet automatically scanned the Internet for additional devices to infect them with malware and add them to the botnet.

### 2 4 espionage attacks using backdoors in IoT devices

At the end of September 2016, it became known that some models of surveillance cameras and room sensors are equipped with backdoors that allow espionage. This particularly applies to surveillance cameras used in data centers and server rooms. The back doors apparently allowed access to the image and video data of the cameras and to copy this data to servers on the Internet. So z. For example, user and administration passwords may be compromised, or device configurations, infrastructure details, and other sensitive information may be accessible to third parties. This facilitates on-going attacks by taking advantage of the habits of the staff.
