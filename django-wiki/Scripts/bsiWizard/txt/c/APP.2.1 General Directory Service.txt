### 1.1 Introduction

A directory service provides information on any objects in a defined manner in a data network. With an object related attributes can be stored, for example, to a user ID name and first name of the user, the personnel number and the computer name. These data can then be used equally by different applications. The directory service and its data are usually managed from a central location.

Some typical uses of directory services are:

* Management of address books, eg. For example, for phone numbers, e-mail addresses, certificates for electronic signatures
* Resource management, eg. For computers, printers, scanners and other peripherals
* User administration, eg. For example, to manage user accounts and user permissions
* Authentication, eg For example, to log on to operating systems or applications
Directory services are optimized for read access because data is typically retrieved from the directory service. Write accesses, such as creating, changing or deleting entries, are less often necessary.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of the module is to operate general directory services securely and to adequately protect the information processed with them.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module considers general security aspects of directory services regardless of the product used. For product-specific security aspects, the IT-Grundschutz Compendium contains further components that must also be applied to the respective directory service.

An example of this is Microsoft Active Directory (see APP.2.2 * Active Directory *). Other directory services are based on the freely available OpenLDAP (see APP.2.3 * OpenLDAP *), which is used in many Unix-based systems and, for example, also used by Apple's macOS. Modules for server systems on which directory services are usually operated are listed in the SYS.1 * Server * layer of the IT Baseline Protection Compendium.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in the area of ​​general directory service:

### 2 1 Lack of or insufficient planning of the use of directory services

The security of directory services relies heavily on the security of the base operating system, and especially on file system security. Directory services can be installed and operated on a variety of operating systems, which can result in a wide variety of security settings to be made. This diversity increases the planning requirements and requires appropriate knowledge of the underlying operating system. If the resulting overall solution is very heterogeneous or complex, an insufficiently planned use of the directory service in active operation can lead to security gaps. Since directory services also make use of role-based administration of the directory database and individual administration tasks can be delegated, incorrect administration of the administration tasks runs the risk of insecure or inadequate administration of the system.

### 2 2 Incorrect or inadequate planning of partitioning and replication in the directory service
Partitioning is a division of the directory data of a directory service into individual subareas (partitions). The replication of partitions of the directory service is usually used for load balancing. Furthermore, the redundancy in the data storage improves the reliability and thus increases the availability. Therefore, a suitable planning is of crucial importance here, since subsequent changes to the partition and replication settings are possible, but can sometimes cause problems. Planning the partitioning and replication of the directory service incorrectly or inadequately may result in data loss, inconsistencies in data management, poor directory service availability, overall poor system performance, and even outages.

### 2 3 Incorrect or inadequate planning of access to the directory service

Managing access and access rights in the context of a directory service is an extremely labor-intensive task, which in extreme cases requires many manual steps that can lead to errors and shortcomings in the overview of work performed. Inadequate planning of whether and what data may be transmitted in clear text may cause inconsistencies or contradictions with organizational security policies. Also, improper planning of directory security security measures and techniques can lead to incompatibilities or even encryption failure to protect confidential data, which can have a direct impact on confidentiality and integrity.

### 2 4 Incorrect administration of access and access rights

Access rights to an IT system and access rights to stored data and IT applications may only be granted to the extent necessary for the tasks to be performed. This also applies to the permissions granted to users and groups managed through a directory service. If these rights are administered incorrectly, this will lead to malfunctions if necessary rights have not been assigned. On the other hand, security vulnerabilities can occur if more than necessary rights are granted. If the access rights in the directory service are assigned incorrectly or inconsistently, the security of the entire system is considerably jeopardized. A particularly critical point is also the administration rights. If these rights are assigned incorrectly, the entire administration concept can be called into question or even the administration of the directory system itself may be blocked.

### 2 5 Incorrect configuration of access to directory services

In many usage scenarios, other applications, such as Internet or intranet applications, must access the directory service. A misconfiguration can lead to incorrect access to access rights or unauthorized access to the directory service, or to the fact that data for authentication can be transmitted in plain text and thus unencrypted information can be spied out.

### 2 6 Directory Services Failure and Encryption Failure

Technical failures due to hardware or software problems may cause directory services or parts thereof to fail. As a result, the data held in the directory are temporarily inaccessible. In extreme cases, data can be lost. This can hinder business processes and internal work processes. If functional copies of the failed system parts are available, access is still possible, but depending on the selected network topology, this may only be limited.

### 2 7 Compromise of directory services due to unauthorized access
If an attacker has managed to successfully bypass a necessary authentication against the directory service, he can generally access a variety of data for which he should not be authorized. Thus, the entire directory service can be compromised. In addition, unauthorized persons could gain access to network resources or services through extended permissions. This can lead to an attacker bypassing all directory service defenses. This could affect or even destroy the affected system. The security of a directory service can also be compromised if anonymous users are allowed. By not checking their identity, anonymous users can first direct arbitrary queries to the directory service, through which they obtain at least partial information about its structure and content. In addition, when anonymous access is allowed, DoS attacks on the directory service are easier to implement because attackers have more accessibility that is difficult to control.
