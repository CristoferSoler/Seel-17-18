### 1.1 Introduction

Mobile media is used for a variety of purposes, such as transporting, storing, or using data on the move. There are many different types of portable media, including external hard drives, CD-ROMs, DVDs, memory cards, magnetic tapes and USB sticks.

Data carriers can be classified according to whether they are read-only, write-once or rewritable. They can also be subdivided according to further criteria, for example the type of data storage (analogue or digital), how they can be processed (without technical aids, such as paper, or only with technical aids, such as DVDs) ) and their design (removable media or external data storage or data carriers integrated with other devices).

### 1.2 Objective

This module shows how the information stored on mobile data carriers can be safely used and how an unauthorized transfer of information via mobile data carriers should be prevented.

### 1.3 Delimitation

This module deals only with the basic security features of mobile data carriers.

The different and sometimes complex requirements for devices that can be used in addition to their main function in addition as a mobile disk, such. As smartphones and tablets are also listed in the blocks that deal with the topic. Likewise, in-depth aspects concerning the exchange of digital as well as analog media are not considered.

Mobile data carriers can be exchanged during personal meetings or by mail. The exchange of digital and analog data carriers to transfer information between different communication partners and IT systems is not considered in this module. For this purpose, the requirements of block OPS.1.2.3 Data medium exchange must be implemented.

In addition to the digital data carriers are z. B. also to consider information on paper or other analog media in the security design. These aspects go beyond the basic security features of mobile data carriers and are therefore covered in other modules (for example [* SYS.4.1 Printers, Copiers and Multifunction Devices *] (DE / topics / IT Grundschutz / IT Grundschutz Compendium / modules / SYS / SYS_4_1_Printers, _Copier_and_Multifunction_C3) % A4te.html? Nn = 10137184 "SYS.4.1 Printers, Copiers and Multifunction Devices"), NET.4.3 Fax, OPS.1.1.5 Data Backup or [* OPS.1.2.2 Archiving *] (DE / Themen / ITBrundschutz / ITBrundschutzKompendium /bausteins/OPS/OPS_1_2_2_Archivierung.html?nn=10137184 "OPS.1.2.2 Archiving")).

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance to mobile media:

### 2 1 Carelessness in handling information

It is frequently observed that organizational regulations and technical security procedures for mobile data carriers exist in institutions, but these are again undermined by the careless handling of specifications and technology. For example, it can be observed again and again that mobile data carriers brought along are left unattended in the meeting room or in the train compartment during the breaks.

### 2 2 Insufficient knowledge of regulations

If employees and officials are not sufficiently familiar with the regulations for the correct handling of mobile data carriers, they can not adhere to it. This can lead to numerous threats to information security, for example when USB sticks are thoughtlessly connected to IT systems in the institution.

### 2 3 Data loss in mobile use
For mobile data carriers, the risk of data loss is higher than for stationary systems. One cause of this may be theft or loss of equipment, but also technical problems or simple lack of power. The information stored on the data carriers is often irretrievably lost.

### 2 4 Broken disk

Mobile data carriers are susceptible to damage, errors or failures due to their size and application fields. Cause are, for example, constantly changing operating environments or mechanical effects.

### 2 5 Theft

Again and again, mobile data carriers are stolen. The smaller and more desirable such devices, such as USB hard drives or USB sticks, the higher this risk. In addition to material loss, further damage can result if sensitive files are lost or disclosed.

### 2 6 Impaired by changing operating environment

Mobile data carriers are used in very different environments and are therefore exposed to many threats. These include, for example, damaging environmental influences, such as too high or too low temperatures, as well as dust or moisture. Other problems caused by device mobility include, for example, shipping damage. Another important aspect is that they are often used in areas with different levels of security. Communication with unknown IT systems and networks always poses a risk potential for your own mobile device. For example, if the media is attached to other IT systems, confidential information that is not intended to be shared can also be copied.

### 2 7 Spread of malware

Mobile data carriers are often used to exchange data between different devices and workplaces. There is a danger that malware will nest on the mobile data carriers and thus transfer to the workstation systems.

### 2 8 Data theft with mobile data carriers

Mobile data carriers, such as. As USB sticks or memory cards, are usually small, unobtrusive and have a high storage capacity. Since almost all IT systems have an appropriate interface for the use of replaceable data carriers, there is a risk that they can copy large amounts of data without authorization and inconspicuity.
