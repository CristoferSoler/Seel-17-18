### 1.1 Introduction

In emergency situations, access to information to restore a business process, an IT system or a specialist task is indispensable. To this end, the relevant processes for maintaining information security in an emergency should be planned, established and reviewed.

Only when planned and organized is an optimal emergency preparedness and emergency management possible. A professional emergency management process reduces their impact and thus ensures the operation and continued existence of the institution. Appropriate measures must be identified and implemented that make business processes and specialist tasks more robust and fail-safe, and that make it possible to handle the emergency quickly and purposefully.

The maintenance of information security must therefore be integrated into a comprehensive emergency management. However, emergency management has its own process manager (the emergency officer) with whom the information security officer coordinates.

### 1.2 Objective

The aim of the module emergency management is to describe requirements that ensure information security even in critical situations. To this end, the corresponding measures are to be embedded in a holistic continuity management and to consider all aspects that are necessary to be able to maintain information security even in the event of a damaging event. This ranges from planning to checking all processes.

### 1.3 Delimitation

When a damage event occurs, the right information must be complete and accurate. In the present module, neither criteria nor processes are explained, by means of which the responsible persons can decide, whether an emergency exists or not. The decision is made while the incident is being handled (see DER.2.1 * Handling Security Incidents *).

Crises are considered in the context of a separate crisis management and in this module only as an interface, eg. As part of the further escalation of emergencies. Further information on the individual phases of emergency management and the definition of emergency management for crisis management are contained in BSI Standard 100-4.

2 risk situation
-----------------

The following specific threats and vulnerabilities are of particular importance in *** *** emergency management:

### 2 1 Staff shortage

If employees fail, z. Eg by germs in the canteen, pandemic, death or strike, the own institution could no longer perform their specialized tasks and business processes and, moreover, relevant information for restarting the business process or the IT systems could no longer be accessible. In many cases, individuals have specific expertise (head monopolies), so that damage can occur even if the number of staff shortages is numerically very low.

### 2 2 Failure of IT systems

If components of an IT system fail, eg. B. by defective hardware or power failure, the entire IT operation can be disturbed. As a result, the availability of the respective information and thus of the respective business process is at risk. In addition, important information needed for recovery operations may not be available.

### 2 3 Failure of a Wide Area Network (WAN)
The causes of the failure of a wide area network (WAN) can be manifold. Therefore, it is possible that a network outage will affect only individual users, a vendor or a specific region. Frequently, such failures only last a short time and only affect the business processes and specialized tasks that require a correspondingly high availability of the WAN. But there are also always longer failures that can cause massive problems in communication and accessibility.

### 2 4 Failure of a building

Buildings can become unusable unpredictably, eg. B. because they were partially or completely destroyed by fire, storm, flood, earthquake or explosion. However, a failure of a building can also be caused by the fact that due to blockades by police or fire brigade, the environment can no longer be entered or the building must be abandoned, because electricity, water, sewage, heating or air conditioning over a period of time no longer work.

### 2 5 Failure of a supplier or service provider

When organizational units depend on service providers, the partial or total failure of an outsourcing service provider or supplier can have a significant impact on business continuity, especially in critical business processes.
