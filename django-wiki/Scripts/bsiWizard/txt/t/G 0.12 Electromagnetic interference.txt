G 0.12 Electromagnetic interference
=======================================

Information technology today consists to a large extent of electronic components. Although optical transmission technology is also increasingly being used, computers, network coupling elements and memory systems, for example, usually contain a large number of electronic components. Electromagnetic interference acting on such components may impair or even impair the function of electronic equipment. As a result, failures, malfunctions, incorrect processing results or communication errors may occur.

Even wireless communication can be affected by electromagnetic interference. Under certain circumstances, a sufficiently severe disturbance of the frequency bands used suffices.

Furthermore, information stored on certain types of media may be erased or corrupted by electromagnetic interference. This applies in particular magnetizable data carriers (hard disks, magnetic tapes, etc.) and semiconductor memory. Even damage to such media by electromagnetic interference is possible.

There are many different sources of electromagnetic fields or radiation, for example radio networks such as WLAN, Bluetooth, GSM, UMTS etc., permanent magnets and cosmic radiation. In addition, each electrical device radiates more or less strong electromagnetic waves, which can spread through the air and along metallic conductors (eg cables, air conditioning ducts, heating pipes, etc.).

In Germany, the Act on the Electromagnetic Compatibility of Equipment (EMVG) contains regulations on this topic.
