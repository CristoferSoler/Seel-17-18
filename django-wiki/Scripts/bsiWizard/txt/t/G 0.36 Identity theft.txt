G 0.36 Identity theft
==========================

In identity theft, an attacker fakes a false identity, so he uses information about another person to appear on their behalf. For this purpose, data such as date of birth, address, credit card or bank account numbers are used, for example, to register at a foreign cost with an Internet service provider or otherwise enrich themselves. Identity theft often leads directly or indirectly to reputational damage, but also causes a great deal of time to clarify the causes and avert negative consequences for those affected. Some forms of identity fraud are also referred to as masquerade.

Identity theft is a common occurrence where ID checks are too careless, especially if they are based on expensive services.

A person who has been misled about the identity of his communication partner can easily be made to reveal sensitive information.

Examples:

* For various e-mail providers and auction platforms on the Internet, it was enough to register at first to come up with a fancy name and submit it with an appropriate address from the phone book. Initially, attackers could also log on under identifiable names, such as cartoon characters. When more stringent plausibility tests were introduced, names, addresses, and account numbers of real people were also used. The persons concerned did not learn about this until the first payment requests arrived.
* The sender addresses of e-mails are easy to fake. It happens again and again that users are pretended in this way that an e-mail comes from a trusted communication partner. Similar attacks are possible by manipulating caller ID on voice connections or by manipulating the sender's ID on fax connections.
* An attacker can use a masquerade to try to connect to an existing connection without having to authenticate himself, as this step has already been taken by the original communication participants.
