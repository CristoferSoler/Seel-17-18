G 0.47 Adverse effects of IT-based attacks
================================================== ====

IT-based attacks can have an impact

* are not intended by the perpetrators or
* do not affect the directly attacked targets or
* harm uninvolved third parties.
This is due to the high complexity and networking of modern information technology and the fact that the dependencies of the targeted targets and the associated processes are generally not obvious.

Among other things, this can lead to the misjudgment of the actual protection requirements of target objects or to the fact that the persons responsible for the target objects have no self-interest in correcting deficiencies of these target objects.

### Examples:

* Bots installed on IT systems, with which the perpetrators can carry out distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS attacks), often pose no direct threat to the infected IT systems themselves, since the DDoS attacks in the Rule against IT systems of third parties.
* Weak points on IoT devices in WLANs can be used by perpetrators as a gateway to attack other major devices on the same WLAN. Therefore, such IoT devices must be protected even if they themselves have only a low protection requirement.
* Ransomware attacks on IT systems may trigger chain reactions and thus critical infrastructures. This, in turn, could lead to supply bottlenecks for the population, even if the perpetrators may not have intended it.
