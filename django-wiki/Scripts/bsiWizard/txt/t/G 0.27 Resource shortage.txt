G 0.27 Resource shortage
=======================

If the resources available in one area are inadequate, bottlenecks in the supply of these resources, overloads and outages can occur. Depending on the nature of the resources involved, a small event whose occurrence was also predictable may ultimately affect a variety of business processes. Resource shortages can occur in IT operations and communication links, but also in other areas of an institution. If only insufficient human, time and financial resources are made available for certain tasks, this can have many negative effects. It can happen, for example, that the roles required in projects are not filled with suitable persons. If resources such as hardware or software are no longer sufficient to meet the requirements, specialized tasks may not be handled successfully.

Frequently, personal, temporal, financial, technical and other deficiencies can still be compensated in regular operation for a limited period of time. Under high time pressure, however, they become all the clearer, for example in emergency situations.

Resources can also be deliberately overloaded if someone intentionally generates an intense demand for equipment and thereby provokes an intensive and permanent disruption of the resource, see also G 0.40 Denial of Service.

Examples:

* Overloaded electric cables heat up, this can lead to a smoldering fire in case of unfavorable laying.
* Running new applications on the network at a higher bandwidth than planned at the time of planning can result in a loss of network availability if the network infrastructure can not scale sufficiently.
* If the administrators only have sporadic control over the log files of their IT because of overloading, attacks may not be detected promptly.
* Web servers can be overloaded by a large amount of concurrent incoming requests, making controlled access to data almost impossible.
* When a company is in bankruptcy, it can happen that there is no money for urgently needed spare parts or that important service providers can not be paid.
