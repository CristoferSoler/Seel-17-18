G 0.11 Failure or disruption of service providers
==============================================

Hardly any institution still works today without service providers such as suppliers or outsourcing providers. If organizational units depend on service providers, outsourcing of external services can hamper their task management. The partial or total failure of an outsourcing service provider or supplier can have a significant impact on business continuity, especially in critical business processes. There are various causes for such failures, such as bankruptcy, unilateral termination of the contract by the service provider or supplier, operational problems, for example, by force of nature or loss of staff. Problems can also arise if the services provided by the service provider do not meet the quality requirements of the client.

It should also be noted that service providers also often rely on subcontractors to provide their services to the client. Disruptions, quality defects and failures on the part of the subcontractors can indirectly lead to adverse effects on the client.

Due to downtimes of IT systems at the service provider or the communication links to this, business processes at the customer can be affected.

An optionally necessary retrieval of outsourced processes can be severely hampered, for example because the outsourced processes are not sufficiently documented or because the previous service provider does not support the retrieval.

Examples:

* A company has installed its servers in a data center of an external service provider. After a fire in this data center, the company's finance department was no longer able to act. There were significant financial losses for the company.
* The just-in-time production of a company was dependent on the supply of resources from external service providers. After a truck failed due to a defect at the service provider, delivery of urgently needed parts was drastically delayed. As a result, a number of customers could not be supplied on time.
* A banking institution handled all cash transports with a value-transporting company. The value-transport company surprisingly filed for bankruptcy. The agreement and tour planning with a new value transporter took several days. As a result, there were significant problems and time delays in the money supply and disposal of bank branches.
