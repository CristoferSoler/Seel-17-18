G 0.25 Failure of equipment or systems
========================================

If time-critical applications are run on an IT system, the consequential damages are correspondingly high after a system failure, if there are no alternatives.

Examples:

* A firmware is imported into an IT system that is not intended for this type of system. The IT system then no longer starts faultlessly and must be made ready for operation again by the manufacturer.
* For an Internet Service Provider (ISP), a power failure in a storage system caused it to shut down. Although the actual error could be remedied quickly, the affected IT systems could not be restarted afterwards because of inconsistencies in the file system. As a consequence, several ISP-operated web servers were unavailable for days.
