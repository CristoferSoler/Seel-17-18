G 0.8 Failure or malfunction of the power supply
==============================================

Despite high security of supply, there are always interruptions of the power supply by the distribution system operators (VNB) or energy supply companies (EVU). The greatest number of these disturbances is so short with times under one second that humans do not notice them. But even interruptions of more than 10 ms are suitable to disrupt the IT operation. In addition to disturbances in the supply network, however, disconnections in the case of work that has not been announced or cable damage during civil engineering work can cause the power supply to fail.

The power supply is not only the obvious, direct power consumers (PC, lighting, etc.) dependent. Many infrastructure facilities today rely on electricity, e.g. Elevators, air conditioning, alarm systems, security locks, automatic door locks and sprinkler systems. Even the water supply in skyscrapers is dependent on the current because of the pumps required for pressure generation in the upper floors. In the event of longer power failures, failure of the infrastructure facilities may result in no longer being able to carry out any activities in the premises concerned.

In addition to failures, other power disturbances may affect operation. Overvoltage, for example, can lead to malfunction or even damage to electrical equipment.

It should also be noted that failures or disruptions to the power supply in the neighborhood may also affect one's own business processes, for example if access roads are blocked.

Examples:

* An error in the UPS of a data center did not return it to normal operation after a brief power failure. After discharging the batteries (after about 40 minutes) all computers in the affected server room fell out.
* In early 2001, there were over 40 days a power emergency in California. The power supply was so tight there that the California grid monitoring authority ordered rotating power cuts. These power cuts, which lasted up to 90 minutes, affected not only households but also the high-tech industry. Because with the power failure also alarm systems and security cameras were turned off, the utilities kept their shutdown plans a secret.
* In November 2005, heavy snowfalls in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia left many communities without power for days on end because many high voltage pylons had fallen under the snow and ice load. The restoration of the power supply took several days.
