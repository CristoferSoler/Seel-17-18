### 1.1 Introduction

The electrotechnical cabling of IT systems and other equipment includes all cables and distributions in the building from the point of entry of the distribution system operator to the electrical connections of the consumers.

Proper and standard compliant electrical wiring is the basis for secure IT operation.

### 1.2 Life cycle

A number of measures have to be implemented for the electrotechnical cabling, starting with the planning through the implementation to the operation. The steps that should be taken and the actions that should be followed in each step are listed below. As with the building, it should also be noted here that the possibilities of influence when moving into an existing building are significantly lower, even when securing the wiring, than when constructing a new building.

** planning and conception **

In the planning phase, the foundations are laid for efficient, well-secured cabling. For this purpose, a requirements analysis should be carried out within the framework of planning and conception (see INF.3.M4 requirements analysis for the electrotechnical cabling).

The mechanical and electrical characteristics of the cabling are determined by the choice of cable types to be used (see INF.3.M1 Selection of suitable cable types) and by cable routing and routes and the environmental conditions (see INF.3.M2 Cable Management Planning). By selecting suitable cable types and type-specific installation (see INF.3.M3 Professional installation), the electrical installation must be made resistant to environmental hazards (see eg INF.3.M6 overvoltage protection and INF.3.M12 avoidance of electrical damage) ignition sources). Whenever possible, care should be taken to ensure that the lines and main and sub-distributions of the building are adequately physically protected against misuse (see INF.3.M14 Material security of electrical wiring and INF.3.M15 Use of cabinet systems) ,

**Implementation**

An essential element of fire safety is the correct installation of cable ducts, which can cause considerable risks due to a lack of fire-barrier insulation (see INF.3.M8 fire-barrier of routes). When installing the cabling, it is also important to pay attention to detailed and correct documentation, since afterwards it is usually very difficult or even impossible to determine where cables are going and what they are connecting (see INF.3.M9 Documentation and marking of electrotechnical cabling and wiring) INF.3.M10 Neutral documentation in the distributors). The electrotechnical cabling should undergo an approval process after completion of the installation, which also includes aspects of information security (see INF.3.M5 Acceptance of electrotechnical cabling).

**Business**

As a basis for safe and trouble-free operation, the systems and their use must be regularly checked (see INF.3.M11 Control of electrical systems and connections). When working on routes, it must be ensured that the fire protection officer is involved in planning and execution in good time (see INF.3.M8 Fire isolation of routes).

** ** segregation

Even electrical cables that are no longer needed must be removed or put out of service properly (see INF.3.M7 Removal and Disabling of Unused Cables).

** emergency care **

If increased availability requirements are met, the wiring, including the external connections, if applicable, should be redundant (see INF.3.M13 Secondary Power Supply).

2 measures
-----------

The following are specific implementation notes in the area of ​​"Electrical wiring" listed.

### 2.1 Basic measures

The following measures should be implemented as a priority:#### INF.3.M1 Selection of suitable cable types

When selecting cables, in addition to the transmission requirements, the ambient conditions during installation as well as during operation must be taken into account. In order to meet these different requirements, cable manufacturers offer different types of cables on the market or develop corresponding solutions.

With regard to the cable sheath for indoor or outdoor installation, the following criteria must be taken into account:

* Temperature,
* surrounding medium (water, sewage, acid, gas, light, soil),
Rodent protection, bat and spade stab resistance, stone chip resistance, water pressure resistance,
* Functional integrity in fire-prone areas,
* special tensile forces by z. B. Overhead use.
In addition, the planned road systems are to be considered, such as cable trays, cable ladder, cable ducts, Kabelzugrohre, Kabelformsteine, riser areas and overhead lines.

The further cable construction must consider the following factors:

* Tensile forces due to mechanical installation, eg. As cable winch, Einblassystem or manual installation,
* Bending radius and transverse pressure stability, according to laying style and resting state in operation,
* Damp or wet areas due to longitudinal water protection,
* special tensile forces in the installed state, which arise due to large clamping or intercepting distances for overhead lines or extreme gradients,
* strong electrical and inductive interference due to cable shielding.
The correct and compliant selection of electric cables and compliance with the relevant standards (DIN VDE 0100 "Regulations for the installation of power installations with rated voltages up to 1000 V", DIN 4102 "Fire behavior of building materials and components") and regulations and the recognized rules of Technology represents the basic emergency precaution of the electrotechnical installation.

Individual requirements for the selection of cables must not be defined exclusively by the IT itself, especially in operating environments in which environmental influences or special structural conditions must be observed. In particular, building services personnel familiar with operations and other special conditions must be involved in the planned cable management, in determining the relevant influences and, thus, the particular requirements for the design of cables.

#### INF.3.M2 Planning the cable management [Head IT]

When planning cable routes, care must be taken to avoid identifiable sources of danger. Basically, routes should only be laid in areas that are accessible only within the premises of an institution. A clear structure of the routes facilitates the control. Routes and individual cables should always be laid in such a way that they are protected against direct damage by persons, vehicles and machines.

The location of equipment should be selected so that the cables connected to it are not in the running or driving area. If this can not be avoided, the cables must be protected according to the expected loads by means of suitable duct systems. As a general rule, make sure there is sufficient strain relief for the cables in the connectors when connecting the device.

Underground garages are a major problem for damage-reducing cable management. Due to the safety circuits and the long open times of entrance gates, the access of third parties to underground garages can never be ruled out. Due to the usually low ceiling heights, it is possible with simple means to gain access to there running paths. Trains in the driving range can be below the permissible vehicle height. Damage or destruction of the tracks and cables due to vehicles that are too high can not be ruled out.In buildings shared with third parties, care must be taken to ensure that cables do not pass through their areas in floor, ceiling or wall ducts. All duct systems are to be closed mechanically in relation to the foreign occupied areas. It is better to let them end at the area borders.

Due to areas with a high risk of fire, as far as possible no cables should be laid. If this is not possible and the functional integrity of all cables lying on the route is required, the corresponding route area must be provided with fire barriers. If the functional integrity is only required for individual cables, a suitable cable and the associated fastening should be selected for this purpose. A function maintenance cable can never fulfill the required function alone. The cable system is to be considered as a whole, including the attachment, such as routes, clamps or pipes. It is equally important that the cable system can not be destroyed by parts above it without function preservation, if they fall in case of fire.

In production plants, high inductive loads and resulting interference fields can be expected. These are also to be considered when laying the tracks and cables. The same applies to the protection of the cables as with the fire barrier.

For ground tracks, a warning tape must be laid about 10 cm above the track. With individual cables (without tube), the installation of cable covers makes sense.

Lines must be routed so that a storm can not move them. For example, it should be ensured that lines are fastened on free roof surfaces in an appropriate manner. It should be taken into account that strong forces can act on the cables or cable strands during a storm. In addition, cables must be protected against mechanical damage as objects could fall on them. Cables on roof surfaces or in areas covered with lamellar walls should therefore always be laid in protective tubes.

Cable ducts (eg floor ducts, sill channels, flatbeds, outside pipes) are to be sufficiently dimensioned. On the one hand, there must be enough space to be able to make any necessary extensions of the network. On the other hand, to prevent crosstalk (interference between cables), minimum spacing between cables may be required. In particular, in the use of common routes for energy and IT cabling to ensure that the routes are separated by a central bar. Just a simple separate management of power cables and IT cables can be disrupted IT usually avoided.

If it is not possible to build roads with sufficient reserves, at least care should be taken that there is enough space in the area of ​​the route to accommodate extensions. If wall and ceiling openings are designed in sufficient size, it is possible to dispense with later noise, dirt and cost-intensive work. When using fire barriers that can be retrofitted, breakthroughs can be prepared in such a way that protection against fire and smoke is always guaranteed, while the tracking of cables remains possible at any time without any problem.

It should be noted that breakthroughs through walls with a fire resistance class may only occupy up to 60% in order to achieve effective partitioning of these openings. If necessary, breakthroughs should be provided for later extensions during the construction and these should initially be closed by means of soft bulkheads or fire protection cushions.

It is important that the route dimensioning must always be planned in connection with the selection of the cable types.The room occupancy and the connection values, for which an electrical installation was designed, are according to experience no longer in accordance with the actual conditions after some time. It is therefore essential to check the electrical installation and, if necessary, adapt it to changes in the use of the room and changes and additions to the technical equipment (IT, air conditioning units, lighting, etc.). This can be done in simple cases by relocation of lines. In some cases, however, it may also be necessary to install additional or completely new infeeds, lines, distributors, etc.

Both in terms of safety and considering the ever-faster data connections on copper lines, it is highly recommended that the power distribution network throughout the building be completely designed as a TN-S system. This is also a requirement of DIN VDE 0100-444. The PE and N conductors are routed separately from the equipotential bonding rail (PAS).

In order to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the TN-S system, it must be ensured that the connection between the PE conductor and the neutral conductor at the PAS (central earthing point) is the only one in the entire network When connecting new devices or switching work in the network, another connection between the PE and N conductors is created by mistake.Therefore, changes in the data network should be coordinated with the building services and a TN-S system should be checked for correct functioning at regular intervals This can be done in the case of power grid testing and suspicion (such as prolonged nonspecific interference in the data network), and ideally a TN-S system will be provided with ZEP permanent power monitoring.

As soon as high or very high demands are placed on the availability of IT, it is usual and appropriate for IT to be supplied via two independent electrical supply lines and for the use of IT devices with two power supplies.

The important consumers (memory components, central network nodes, important servers) are connected to the independent supplies "Network 1" and "Network 2". Other IT components, to which only a few high demands are made, are evenly distributed to the supply lines.

In this case, it must be ensured, especially with devices that are simply connected, that devices that provide each other with redundancy are not connected to the same supply. In addition, the devices must be distributed equally to their power consumption on both strands to avoid network load.

All work on pipe and cable ducts which in any way touch wall penetrations as well as necessary corridors, escape and rescue routes are to be carried out exclusively in agreement with the fire protection officer. This contact must be made so clearly in advance of the actual work that the fire protection officer has sufficient opportunity to incorporate all aspects of Structural Fire Prevention into the planning and execution of the intended work.

The fire safety officer must be given the opportunity to check the correct execution of fire protection measures, even during ongoing work, by providing timely information before they become inaccessible as a result of the construction progress. B. because a suspended ceiling has already been closed.

The involvement of the fire protection officer must be ensured by appropriate organizational instructions and documented in the planning and acceptance documents of the construction project.

#### INF.3.M3 Professional installationThe installation work of the electrotechnical wiring must be done carefully and expertly. At the same time, all relevant standards must be observed. The decisive criteria for a professional execution of the electrotechnical cabling must therefore be checked by the client in all phases. It is the responsibility of the executing company to check, when the material is delivered, that the correct cables and connection components have been supplied. When laying power cables, special care must be taken to ensure that the installation does not cause damage and that the cable routes are such that damage to the routed cables due to normal use of the building is excluded. In addition, care must generally be taken that IT cables are routed separately from the electrotechnical cabling.

### 2.2 Standard measures

Together with the basic measures, the following measures correspond to the state of the art in the field of "electrical wiring".

#### INF.3.M4 Requirements analysis for electrotechnical cabling

Requirements that could influence the future-proof, needs-based and cost-effective performance of electrical wiring should be analyzed in advance of major cabling work. In a requirements analysis, it should first be estimated which amounts of electricity are to be used by which users at short notice by the users in the institution and how the longer-term development of the use will be based on this.

#### INF.3.M5 Decrease in electrotechnical cabling

The electrotechnical cabling must be subjected to a acceptance process in accordance with the relevant DIN VDE regulations after completion of the installation. In principle, the aspects of information security (see also INF.3.M11 Control of electrical equipment and connections) must be taken into account.

An acceptance should only be made when all the tasks to be carried out have been completed, the contractor has notified the measure of acceptance and no unacceptable deficiencies have been identified during the inspections by the contracting authority. The acceptance date should be selected in time so that the controls can be prepared for acceptance in sufficient time. In addition to the correct billing and the actual scope of the services, compliance with the different standards for electrical wiring must be checked during the acceptance. Upon acceptance, it should also be considered whether the firewall was properly restored after installation.

A checklist can be prepared for the acceptance report. The checklist should also contain points regarding general requirements for the premises. The acceptance protocol must be signed by the participants and responsible persons in a legally binding manner. The protocol should be part of the internal documentation of the cabling.

#### INF.3.M6 overvoltage protection

In any electrically conductive network, whether it is the power supply or the data transmission, it can come at any time to overvoltages. Predominantly such overvoltages are caused by other current consumers in the same supply network. Lightning overvoltages, on the other hand, are much rarer, but have much greater potential for damage.

Overvoltages can enter into a building and the IT operated there, not just via the lines laid in the building, but also via all electrically conductive external connections such as telephone, water or gas lines. In addition, overvoltages can also be coupled to internal lines.The necessary measures to protect IT equipment are essentially the same regardless of the cause of the overvoltage. The standard DIN EN 62305 "Lightning Protection" valid since October 2006 (corresponds to the standard VDE 0185-305 and IEC 62305) reorganizes the entire lightning and surge protection.

Based on the new standard DIN EN 62305 an overvoltage protection concept has to be created.

For the first time in its Part 2 "Risk Management", DIN EN 62305 describes the way to a risk-oriented lightning and surge protection for the first time in a generally binding manner. Part 3 deals with the "Protection of Structures and Persons", in Part 4 "Electrical and Electronic Systems in Buildings".

In the overvoltage protection concept, of course, stand-alone power supply systems (NEA) and uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) must be taken into account. Although UPSs provide some protection to the connected equipment, they are in no way to be considered a surge protector, but solely as an electronic device to be protected.

The former three levels of coarse, medium and fine protection have been replaced by the concept of energetic coordination. According to the standard, overvoltage protection in the building and thus respect for the energetic coordination is only imperative if there is external lightning protection. In the interests of information security, overvoltage protection should also be built up in cases without external lightning protection in the building and consequently the energetic coordination should be considered. Simplified, this means the following:

* Behind each protection element (SPD - Surge Protecting Device), the maximum amount of energy caused by overvoltage must be the same as that of all the electrical devices behind it (including the following SPDs). A pure network is of course much more robust and tolerates significantly more energy than z. B. the interface of a network card in a PC.
* All used SPDs must be compatible. The output of an upstream SPD and the input of the following must be matched. Evidence of energetic coordination can be provided in three ways:
The construction of the lightning and overvoltage protection means that lightning protection zones (LPZ, LPZ, Lightning Protection Zone) are formed like onion shells. With increasing protection they are called from outside to inside with LPZ 0, LPZ 1, LPZ 2 etc. In this case, a zone can only be formed if there is the next outer one: Thus, it is not possible to realize an LPZ 2 without having the LPZ 1 as well.

For simple electrical and electromechanical devices, the LPZ 1 is usually sufficient. To protect electronic devices (IT hardware, UPS, etc.), at least the LPZ 2 must be implemented. For particularly sensitive devices, such. B. in medical or instrumentation can quite the LPZ 3 may be required.

**Note:**

The LPZ (lightning protection zones) should not be confused with the protection classes of the external lightning protection system, which is called LPS (Lightning Protection System).

Whether an LPS is required and with which protection class must be decided on the basis of the risk assessment (in accordance with Part 2 of DIN EN 62305). The earlier sufficient view into a building list is no longer enough!

In many cases, it is not necessary to build a LPZ 2 or LPZ 3 building-wide. While the transition from LPZ 0 (which is anything outside of a building, where lightning can actually strike directly) to LPZ 1 actually has to be as close to the building envelope as possible, the construction of higher LPZ can be done anywhere and to any extent , However, it is important to ensure that no line that only enjoys the protection of the LPZ 1 (eg heating pipes) passes through higher-quality LPZ.The previously required minimum line lengths between the SPDs, ie the protective elements, and the different LPZs are no longer compulsory today. There are SPDs that realize the transition from the LPZ 0 directly into the LPZ 2 in one component.

The protective effect of an SPD extends on both sides (to the incoming and outgoing line) only over a specific cable route, which must be named in detail by the manufacturer. If the cable length is exceeded, repeatedly install SPDs to maintain protection.

According to DIN EN 62305, lightning protection systems (LPS) must be checked at intervals of 1 to 4 years, depending on the protection class. For surge protective devices, the standard does not provide for explicit test intervals. For the purposes of information security, however, all SPDs should be reviewed periodically (at least once a year) and after known events and replaced if necessary. To be able to carry out this test at all, only those SPDs should be installed, if available, which have a built-in defect indicator or (even better) a life indicator.

In addition to overvoltage protection on all electrically conductive systems, measures against electrostatic charge must be taken in server rooms and the core units of a data center. The volume resistance of floor coverings in such rooms must be between 10 and 100 megohms. The classification according to DIN regulation 4102-1 "Fire behavior of building materials and components" must reach at least "B1 flame retardant". This also applies to a raised floor or installation floor.

Regardless of the scope and expansion of the overvoltage protection, it must be ensured that a comprehensive equipotential bonding of all electrical equipment included in the overvoltage protection is required! The majority of damage to IT equipment due to overvoltages can be attributed to incorrectly implemented equipotential bonding.

Some malfunctions that adversely affect the proper functioning of IT, and thus their availability and integrity, are achieved through electrically conductive media. Particularly relevant here are couplings of interfering signals of different origin as well as overvoltages caused by lightning or switching operations. These disturbances can be quite effectively prevented if external lines are galvanically separated and thus the electrical propagation path of the disturbance is interrupted, but this is not always possible.

In the normal power supply, the use of isolating transformers would indeed be a galvanic isolation. However, disturbing voltage spikes and other interference signals would also be transmitted one-to-one. Only the bandpass effect of a transformer would possibly reduce the interference somewhat.

Due to the fact that isolating transformers have only a limited effect and since these are generally not applicable in data lines, the above-mentioned galvanic isolation is not relevant in practice. Instead, the risks arising from voltage surges and surges on the power supply can be sufficiently reduced if the overvoltage protection measures are implemented.

Of course, other media lines (coolant and condensate of a cold supply, normal water or gas pipes, etc.) must also be considered. If the guided medium itself is electrically conductive, ie water (also the main constituent of cooling liquids), then it is hardly expedient to interrupt the otherwise performed in copper or steel piping by plastic. Again, then only the relevant measures of surge protection.

Only with gas lines, a non-conductive pipe section can cause a true electrical isolation.

#### INF.3.M7 Remove and disable unnecessary linesUnnecessary lines are those lines that are no longer required for the function of the building due to changes in use or modernization measures. These lines should always be completely removed in order to limit the fire loads in the building to the minimum necessary and to fill the existing routes only to the required extent. When removing cables, make sure that the fire barriers are properly closed again after the cables have been removed.

Which cables are no longer needed may only be decided after careful examination by the responsible organizational unit. The decision has to be documented.

If the changes to the cabling infrastructure are carried out parallel to the operation of the service, the measures must be organized in such a way that the disruption to service operations is reduced to a minimum. For this purpose, weekend and night work may also have to be scheduled. If there is not enough space in the existing lines for the old and new cables, then new lines for the new cables have to be installed in order to minimize the switching time from the still running old infrastructure to the new infrastructure.

Routes and cables that can be reasonably used as reserve with the existing technology must be marked explicitly on the cable itself and in the documentation as a non-operational reserve and must be kept in an operable condition.

In the operating documentation, all changes must be documented in an auditable manner.

It is advisable to check the changes expertly at reasonable intervals and in any case after line work. These checks must be logged.

#### INF.3.M8 Fire protection in paths

Electric cables are typically concentrated in installation lines. It can often be stated that paths lead along escape and rescue routes, through underground car parks, warehouses, workshops or as transit routes through foreign areas of use.

For buildings with several fire compartments, the execution of electrical cables is subject to fire safety regulations. This applies in particular to cables that pass through fire compartments, walls or ceilings or that have been laid in traffic routes. Especially if the routes are used for fire alarm, alerting, extinguishing or emergency lighting, additional requirements for functional integrity of electric cables in case of fire must be observed. Therefore, the fire protection officer should always be consulted when planning the routes. Routes must provide both fire protection and protection against sabotage. Both can be achieved by a professional partitioning of the routes.

If electrical cables are routed in a considerable packing density in the fire protection cut cable duct, larger temperature increases can occur. This can cause an increase in electrical line resistance with additional heating. Therefore, the specifications in DIN VDE 0100-520 "Installation of low-voltage systems - Part 5: Selection and erection of electrical equipment - Chapter 52: Cable and line systems" as German version of IEC 60364-5-52 depending on the type of installation must be observed. This is the responsibility of the electrician.

Breakthroughs must be sealed after laying the cables according to the fire resistance class of the wall or ceiling. In order to facilitate the subsequent installation, suitable materials such as soft-bulkheads or fire-protection cushions can be used for measures with a temporary character. Corresponding standards and guidelines, such as DIN 4102 "Fire behavior of building materials and components", must be observed. Cable trays stretch when heated z. B. by fire and can destroy a soft or cushion bulkhead when they are passed through walls.Therefore, routes should not be passed through the bulkhead, but end on both sides at least 10 cm in front of the wall. This practice also facilitates fanning out the cables and lines that do not need to be bundled but individually routed through the bulkhead.

Frequently in a route different cables, z. B. for telephone, LAN and building services. If there are any changes to the cabling, it should be clarified already in the planning phase whether other cable systems should also be replaced in the foreseeable future. A corresponding pooling of projects minimizes downtime and saves additional costs for multiple firewalling.

If the planned route is not possible according to the fire protection regulations, an alternative route must be checked. In addition, after completion of the installation work, the fire barrier should be checked at regular intervals, for example annually.

#### INF.3.M9 Documentation and marking of electrotechnical cabling

Maintenance, troubleshooting, repair, and successful cabling verification requires good documentation and clear identification of all associated components. The quality of this revision documentation depends on the completeness, the topicality and the readability of the documents. In any case, a person responsible for the documentation of the wiring must be named.

Since it is not possible to accommodate all the information in a plan as the size of a network increases, it makes sense to divide up the information. Actual position information should always be drawn in scale plans. Other information can be kept in tabular or schematics. It is important that there is a clear assignment of all information among each other. The documentation should therefore consist of descriptive documents, lists and plans.

The descriptive documents, such as For example, a documentation policy contains the information about the procedures for documentation, designation and labeling regulations. This should, for example, describe in a general way which lists and plans are to be created and how these are to be audit-proof.

The inventory plans typically consist of:

* Site maps and dimensioned site plans with the exact routing of the routes and the primary cabling,
* Building sections as schematics and dimensioned floor plans with the exact location and management of the distribution rooms, routes and cables and the sockets per room in z. B. parapet ducts and / or floor outlets,
* Engineering room plans with room layout, double floor grid and cabinet positioning, power distribution and equipotential busbar as well as existing air conditioning as well as
* Cabinet view plans for the correct description of the installed passive and active components including the socket strips.
It must be possible to use this documentation to quickly and easily get an accurate picture of the cabling.

The type of documentation is similar to that of IT cabling. It therefore makes sense to lead both together.

To ensure the up-to-dateness of the documentation, it must be ensured that all work on the cabling is known in good time and completely to the person who maintains the documentation. It is Z. For example, it is conceivable to make the issue of material, the assignment of third-party orders or the release of secured areas dependent on the recording of this function.

Since this documentation contains sensitive information, it must be stored securely and the access to be regulated.It makes sense to start with the documentation already during the planning of cabling measures in a tool and to transfer this from the planning status to the productive status after the implementation. In this way, it is easier to inform the users of the documentation about upcoming changes and keep the documentation up to date.

#### INF.3.M10 Neutral documentation in the distributors

Each distributor should have documentation that reflects the current status of shunting and line assignments. This documentation should be kept as neutral as possible, but at the same time it must enable secure switching in the distribution. In addition to existing and used connections, this may also include existing reserve lines. Unless expressly required (eg for lines of the safety power supply), no instructions should be given on the type of use of the cables. Line, distribution and room numbers are sufficient in many cases. All further information must be listed in a revision documentation.

#### INF.3.M11 Control of electrical equipment and connections

After installation and then at regular intervals, electrical installations must be checked.

The initial type test is described in the standard DIN-VDE 0100-610 "Installation of low-voltage systems - Part 6-61: Tests - Initial tests" (German version of IEC 60364-6-61). The examination must be carried out by a state-recognized expert. The inspector inspects the installations and their execution on site and carries out test measurements. Here it is checked whether

* all electrical systems have been built according to the manufacturer's specifications,
* Firebox were installed correctly,
* a correct selection of conductors has been made in terms of current carrying capacity, selection and adjustment of the protective equipment and compliance with the planning,
* Schematics are complete and correct,
* Warnings have been attached
* all conductors are properly connected,
* the continuity of the protective conductor is given.
In addition, the initial test includes the measurement of the insulation resistance of the whole installation and the verification and proof of protection by automatic switch-off.

The result of the initial test is the determination of the operational safety and effectiveness of the electrical equipment.

Electrical systems must also be regularly checked for operational safety by an expert. In addition to the primary protection goal of accident prevention, the impact of changes in use (eg due to a sharp increase in the number of consumers) must be checked and documented. The test reports with the results of the tests and measurements should be archived.

** electric distribution **

The entire electrical distribution, mainly circuit breakers as well as screw connections and terminal points, is subject to aging like all technical devices. It must therefore be checked at regular intervals in accordance with DIN VDE 0105-100: 2005-06 "Operation of electrical systems".

In the event of damage, a trader must furnish proof of the perfect condition of the electrical system to the trade supervisory authorities, the professional associations and the insurance companies.

In Germany the Berufsgenossenschaftliche regulation for safety and health at work (BGV, A3 - Electrical installations and equipment) prescribes the following regular examinations:

* electrical equipment and stationary equipment: at least every 4 years,
* mobile devices: depending on the device type at least every 6 months up to at least every 2 years.
Among the portable devices include power strips, but also many IT devices such as workstations.Although the DGUV-V3 is a pure accident prevention regulation, the knowledge gained from the test based on it can and should be taken into account in the VDE-based tests.

** ** logging

All tests and their results must be documented in a suitable form.

#### INF.3.M12 Avoidance of electrical ignition sources

The major part of structural fire protection measures aims to limit developing fires, as well as to allow the escape of persons and the deployment of rescue workers. On the development of fires, these measures usually have little influence.

Here, the individual has to pay special attention and precaution in his daily work environment. In addition to the well-known and obvious sources of fire such as ashtrays, the "tip in the trash" or Christmas candle decorations attention must be paid to the less obvious electrical ignition sources.

**Electrical appliances**

When new private household appliances are purchased, the still functioning old appliances continue to be used as a "donation" during operation. It is overlooked that just old electrical appliances with their age-related much more likely defects represent a particularly high fire hazard.

The use of private electrical appliances within a company or authority must therefore be clearly regulated. It should only be allowed as an exception if such equipment has been previously tested by a qualified electrician and found safe. Of course, this inspection requirement applies to all electrical appliances provided by the institution. Approved equipment should be specially marked so that unauthorized equipment can be easily detected and withdrawn from service.

Especially refrigerators that run in continuous operation, and coffee machines that often stay on for hours, should only be operated in rooms that are expressly and structurally intended for (tea kitchens, etc.).

** ** power strips

No matter how many sockets are provided by the architect, there are always too few or they are in the wrong place. To then provide missing sockets, often socket strips are used. If these are of inadequate quality or are used improperly, such power strips represent a dangerous source of ignition.

The use of power strips should be avoided as much as possible. Missing sockets should be retrofitted by a qualified electrician in existing trunking systems or professionally mounted on plaster.

If this is not possible and therefore the use of power strips is unavoidable, please note:

* Only high-quality socket strips may be used that have been checked by a qualified electrician and found to be safe.
* It should be used single enough power strip instead of several smaller.
* Socket strips must never be inserted one behind the other.
* Socket strips must never be overloaded. In general, the limit is 3500 watts. Here, the nameplate must be observed.
* Socket strips must not be in the foot area at the workplace or in traffic areas.
**Fan**

Dust-blocked fans can overheat the IT equipment being cooled, but can also become a source of fire.

Fans should therefore be checked and cleaned at regular intervals for free concentricity and for dust deposits. This should be done at least once a year and, if there is a need for it, more often.

### 2.3 Measures for increased protection requirementsThe following are proposed measures that go beyond the state of the art level of protection and should be considered in case of increased protection needs. The letters in brackets indicate which basic values ​​are given priority protection by the measure (C = confidentiality, I = integrity, A = availability).

#### INF.3.M13 Secondary Power Supply (A)

The primary energy supply from an energy supply company's network should be supplemented with emergency care measures, such as server rooms, with increased availability requirements.

The secondary power supply usually consists of a central UPS for the areas to be protected and a network backup system (NEA). If the local conditions and the requirement profile for availability permit it, a second supply from the network of a second energy supply company can fulfill this drop-in function instead of a NEA.

While a UPS bypasses fluctuations or short-term interruptions in the power supply, an emergency power system catches longer-term power outages.

Further explanations on redundancy and the closely related aspects of modularity and scalability can be found in INF.2 Rechenzentrum.

With a prolonged failure of the primary power supply, a NEA is indispensable for maintaining IT operations. Their need for protection therefore corresponds to that of the IT that supplies them. Particular attention should be paid to protection against fire and water as well as access by unauthorized persons.

To maintain the protection of a NEA and a UPS, they must be serviced regularly. For this, the maintenance intervals provided by the manufacturer must be observed. During this service, load and function tests should also be performed. In addition, a test run of the UPS and NEA must be performed under real conditions (as a "black building test") at least once every 2 years.

#### INF.3.M14 A-B supply (A)

In a redundant power supply by means of a so-called A-B supply their functionality is usually permanently monitored anyway that devices with two power supplies that are A-B-powered, can report the failure of one of the two supplies via network protocols. If this possibility does not exist or can not be used for certain reasons, the availability of the A-B supply can also be B. be monitored by means of building control (GLT).

In the area of ​​the upstream distribution (from the main distribution up to and including the last distribution before the consumers), the lines should be kept separate from each other in terms of space and fire protection. This is the only way to ensure that the redundancy brought about by the A-B supply is optimal.

The last distributions (A and B) before the consumers are at least so far apart in the impossibility of a spatially separated arrangement that it is not possible for one person to be active in both distributions at the same time.

In the end of the distribution (ie between the last distribution and the consumers) is a fire protection technically separate installation hardly feasible and can therefore be omitted. Spatially separate installation should, however, be realized as far as possible. As a result, the risk that accidental damage to the supply lines both ways, so the A and the B-way hits, significantly minimized.

#### INF.3.M15 Material security of electrical wiring (A)

In rooms with public traffic or in confusing areas of a building, it may make sense to secure lines and distribution boards against unauthorized access. This can be achieved in several ways:

* Laying the cables or cable ducts under plaster,
* Laying the pipes in steel armored pipe,* Laying the cables in mechanically strong and lockable channels,
* Lock of distributors and
* electrical monitoring of distributors and channels.
In any case, the number of points where the routed cable is accessible must be minimized and the length of the connections to be protected against unauthorized access minimized.

In particular, the protection of central routes and cables of the electrical supply must be adapted to the risk situation throughout the entire cable route. In areas such as underground car parks and also in corridors used as transport routes, adequate protection against accidental mechanical damage and, if necessary, against acts of sabotage, must be provided by a stable sheathing of the route or the cable.

When distributors are locked, regulations are needed that set access rights to the distributor, distribution of keys, and access modalities. Among other things, this must specify what to do before making changes to cables or distributors and after performing such work. It must be ensured that changes are coordinated and approved and that the documentation is updated.

#### INF.3.M16 Use of Cabinet Systems (A)

To improve the operational safety of electrical connections and distributors, these devices should be installed or set up in cubicle systems (see also INF.6 protective cabinet).

#### INF.3.M17 firewall cadastre (A)

There should be a firewall cadastre that meets at least the following requirements:

* In the cadastre all bulkheads are to be included, so pure cable bulkheads, pipe bulkheads, combination fumigants etc.
* Each firewall in the building or in the property must be managed individually in the cadastre. (The inclusion of bulkheads in the cadastre may be omitted for bulkheads whose failure demonstrably has no adverse effect on the IT operation of the building or property.)
* Each firewall is listed in the cadastre under an individual unique identification. This identification must be affixed in the immediate vicinity of the relevant bulkhead (as far as possible on both sides) in a legible manner.
* In the cadastre for each bulkhead individually the proof of at least annual visual inspection with the resulting findings is to lead.
* In the cadastre are for Schotts, which are already installed at the time of the creation of the cadastre, all available information structured, so at least:

 
+ Installation location
+ Manufacturer of the bulkhead
+ Product name


 
* The general building inspectorate approvals (AbZ) valid at the time of construction or the general building authority test certificates (AbP). These AbZ and AbP are usually valid for only 5 years and will either be extended or canceled. Often it is very difficult to find references to expired AbZ or AbP on the Internet.
* Installation date
* Installation company and a current photo of both sides of the built-in bulkhead.
In the case of existing bulkheads, it may be imperative in individual cases in the case of unclear circumstances to replace it with a new one. The following specifications apply to such a bulkhead:

* For all newly installed or altered bulkheads after the first compilation of the land registry, at least the following additional information must be included in the land register:

 
+ Complete photo documentation of all essential single steps of installation or conversion,
+ Reason for the conversion,
+ Proof that the materials used in the conversion are approved by the manufacturer of the bulkhead for the conversion.
+ All entries in the cadastre must be made immediately, at the latest 4 weeks after completion of the work.After a conversion, the old certificate at the place of installation must be clearly marked as invalid but in such a way that all relevant technical information can still be read and supplemented by a new certificate taking into account the conversion.
