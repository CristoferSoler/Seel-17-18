G 0.22 Manipulation of information
=====================================

Information can be manipulated in a variety of ways, e.g. For example, by incorrect or intentionally incorrect data capture, content changes of database fields or correspondence. Basically, this does not only apply to digital information, but also, for example, documents in paper form. However, a perpetrator can only manipulate the information he has access to. The more access rights a person has to files and directories of IT systems, or the more access to information they have, the more serious manipulations they can make. If the manipulations are not detected early, the smooth running of business processes and specialized tasks can be severely disturbed.

Archived documents usually represent information worthy of protection. The manipulation of such documents is particularly serious, as it may only be noticed years later and often no longer possible.

Example:

* An employee was so annoyed about her roommate's promotion in the bookkeeping department that she gained unauthorized access to her computer during a brief absence of her colleague. Here it has taken a huge negative impact on the published annual results of the company through some changes in the monthly balance sheet.
