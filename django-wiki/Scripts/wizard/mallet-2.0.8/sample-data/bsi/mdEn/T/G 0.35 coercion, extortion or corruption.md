G 0.35 Coercion, blackmail or corruption
===========================================

Coercion, blackmail, or corruption can compromise the security of information or business processes. By threatening violence or other disadvantages, an attacker may, for example, try to bring the victim to disregard safety guidelines or to circumvent security measures (coercion).

Instead of threatening, attackers can also target money or other benefits to make employees or other people a security breach (corruption). For example, there is a risk that a corrupt employee forwards confidential documents to unauthorized persons.

Coercion or corruption can fundamentally affect all basic information security values. Attacks may target, among other things, the misdirection of confidential information, the manipulation of business-critical information, or the disruption of business processes.

There is a particular danger of such attacks being directed against high-level executives or persons in special trusts.
