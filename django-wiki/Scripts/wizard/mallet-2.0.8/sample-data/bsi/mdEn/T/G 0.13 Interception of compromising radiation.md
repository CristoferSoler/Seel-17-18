G 0.13 Interception of compromising radiation
============================================

Electrical devices emit electromagnetic waves. For devices that process information (such as computers, monitors, network couplers, printers), this radiation can also carry the information that is being processed. Such information-carrying radiation is called exposing or compromising radiation. For example, an attacker who is in a neighboring house or in a nearby parked vehicle may try to receive that radiation and reconstruct the processed information therefrom. The confidentiality of the information is thus called into question. One possible objective of such an attack is industrial espionage.

The limits of the Electromagnetic Compatibility Act (EMCA) are generally insufficient to prevent the interception of the radiative emission. If this risk can not be accepted, additional protective measures usually have to be taken.

Exposing radiation is not limited to electromagnetic waves. Also, sound waves, such as printers or keyboards, may provide useful information.

It should also be noted that exposing radiation in certain cases may also be caused or aggravated by external manipulation of equipment. For example, irradiating a device with electromagnetic waves may cause the reflected waves to carry confidential information.
