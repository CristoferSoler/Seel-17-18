\section{Overview}
The goal of this project is to design, implement and provide a guidance Platform for development Country, e.g. Afghanistan. Taking the circumstances in such development Country in account, the platform should provide the users of IT-Systems with the knowledge to assure the sustainability of IT-Systems in their countries. Besides providing general information of the IT-Systems, the platform should provide, similar as in the “BSI Grundschutzkatalog”, information aiming to localize and solve problematics that may occur to the IT-Systems as a result of a human error, technical failure or a catastrophe etc. 

\section{Wiki}
Considering the limited availability of IT-specialists in most of the development countries, and after reviewing the possible ways to design and provide the platform, our team consider it convenient to create an open Platform in which people can collaboratively add, edit, delete or archive content (Wiki). This should allow the platform to constantly grow and stay relevant to the current circumstances. This anyway shouldn’t mean that everyone can write whatever content for everybody to read. To assure that we have to set rules and access permission levels.

\section{BSI Catalog}

The newest English version of the BSI catalogue has been published in a single PDF file in 2015. This makes browsing the catalogue, or even searching a specific problem, a difficult task for beginners. Therefore the BSI Catalogue should be added as an "locked" Article, only modifiable by Moderators or Administrators.
\\\\
In fact, converting catalogues in articles by hand would be an interminable task. Accordingly, a parser is needed. This parser will analyse the PDF file and create the article automatically. Further, the BSI provides cross-reference tables of the catalogue. These amend the useful links inside each subsection and could be used to recommend cross-referenced counter-measures to specific threats.
