\chapter{Secondary Objectives}
\section{API for BSI Catalog}
The application programming interface (API) should offer straightforward REST access to read, create, edit and possibly manage the content of the wiki heeding the permission settings in place.
This includes the News section, tutorials as well as the BSI catalogue itself.
Such access could be used for a future integration into a mobile application.
Existing wiki-frameworks might already include ready-to-use API functionalities and could be used.

\section{User Access to BSI Catalogue Pages}
While the general access to alter the pages of the BSI catalogue should be restrictive (see section~\ref{BSIc}) users who write an article should still be allowed to link their article in the pages of the BSI catalogue.
This can be done in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a text link where a word becomes the link; the linked page directly comments on a word or phrase or
    \item a bottom page link after the BSI catalogue content that is commenting on the wider scope of the whole page
        .
\end{enumerate}
This means that after or while users write their articles they are presented with the option to link it to the BSI catalogue.
Users then navigate to the page in question which is greyed out/non-editor/read-only.
In the first case, users click on/mark the word they want to link their article to.
In the second case, they click on/mark the ``See also'' section on the BSI catalogue page.

\subsection{Auto-Archiving}
\label{archive_relcon}
Related content to a BSI catalogue version refers to wiki content created by users which is obsolete with the new catalogue version. 
An indicator for the obsolescence is that during a BSI catalogue update the article is only linked to the current catalogue but will not get relinked to the new version.
